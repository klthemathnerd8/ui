Since $30\%$ of the original $30$ liters of paint was yellow, and 5 liters of yellow paint were added to make the new mixture, there are $9+5=14$ liters of yellow tint in the new mixture. Since only 5 liters of paint were added to the original 30, there are a total of 35 liters of paint in the new mixture. This gives $40\%$ of yellow tint in the new mixture, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) 40}}$.
