==Problem==

A bag contains four pieces of paper, each labeled with one of the digits $1$, $2$, $3$ or $4$, with no repeats. Three of these pieces are drawn, one at a time without replacement, to construct a three-digit number. What is the probability that the three-digit number is a multiple of $3$?
$ \textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{3}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{2}{3}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{3}{4} $
