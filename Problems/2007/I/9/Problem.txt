== Problem ==
In [[right triangle]] <math>ABC</math> with [[right angle]] <math>C</math>, <math>CA = 30</math> and <math>CB = 16</math>.  Its legs <math>CA</math> and <math>CB</math> are extended beyond <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>.  [[Point]]s <math>O_1</math> and <math>O_2</math> lie in the exterior of the triangle and are the centers of two [[circle]]s with equal [[radius|radii]].  The circle with center <math>O_1</math> is tangent to the [[hypotenuse]] and to the extension of leg <math>CA</math>, the circle with center <math>O_2</math> is [[tangent]] to the hypotenuse and to the extension of [[leg]] <math>CB</math>, and the circles are externally tangent to each other.  The length of the radius either circle can be expressed as <math>p/q</math>, where <math>p</math> and <math>q</math> are [[relatively prime]] [[positive]] [[integer]]s.  Find <math>p+q</math>.
