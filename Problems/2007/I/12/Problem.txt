== Problem ==
In [[isosceles triangle]] <math>\triangle ABC</math>, <math>A</math> is located at the [[origin]] and <math>B</math> is located at <math>(20,0)</math>.  Point <math>C</math> is in the first quadrant with <math>AC = BC</math> and angle <math>BAC = 75^{\circ}</math>.  If triangle <math>ABC</math> is rotated counterclockwise about point <math>A</math> until the image of <math>C</math> lies on the positive <math>y</math>-axis, the area of the region common to the original and the rotated triangle is in the form <math>p\sqrt{2} + q\sqrt{3} + r\sqrt{6} + s</math>, where <math>p,q,r,s</math> are integers.  Find <math>\frac{p-q+r-s}2</math>.
