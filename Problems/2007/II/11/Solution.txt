If it werenâ€™t for the small tube, the larger tube would travel <math>144\pi</math>. Consider the distance from which the larger tube first contacts the smaller tube, until when it completely loses contact with the smaller tube.

Drawing the radii as shown in the diagram, notice that the [[hypotenuse]] of the [[right triangle]] in the diagram has a length of <math>72 + 24 = 96</math>. The horizontal line divides the radius of the larger circle into <math>72 - 24 = 48</math> on the top half, which indicates that the right triangle has leg of 48 and hypotenuse of 96, a <math>30-60-90 \triangle</math>. 

Find the length of the purple arc in the diagram (the distance the tube rolled, but not the horizontal distance). The sixty degree [[central angle]] indicates to take <math>\frac{60}{360} = \frac 16</math> of the circumference of the larger circle (twice), while the <math>180 - 2(30) = 120^{\circ}</math> central angle in the smaller circle indicates to take <math>\frac{120}{360} = \frac 13</math> of the circumference. This adds up to <math>2 \cdot \frac 16 144\pi + \frac 13 48\pi = 64\pi</math>. 

The actual horizontal distance it takes can be found by using the <math>30-60-90 \triangle</math>s. The missing leg is equal in length to <math>48\sqrt{3}</math>. Thus, the total horizontal distance covered is <math>96\sqrt{3}</math>. 

Thus, we get <math>144\pi - 64\pi + 96\sqrt{3} = 80\pi + 96\sqrt{3}</math>, and our answer is <math>\boxed{179}</math>.
