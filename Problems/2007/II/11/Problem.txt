== Problem ==
Two long [[cylinder|cylindrical]] tubes of the same length but different [[diameter]]s lie [[parallel]] to each other on a [[plane|flat surface]]. The larger tube has [[radius]] <math>72</math> and rolls along the surface toward the smaller tube, which has radius <math>24</math>. It rolls over the smaller tube and continues rolling along the flat surface until it comes to rest on the same point of its [[circumference]] as it started, having made one complete revolution. If the smaller tube never moves, and the rolling occurs with no slipping, the larger tube ends up a [[distance]] <math>x</math> from where it starts. The distance <math>x</math> can be expressed in the form <math>a\pi+b\sqrt{c},</math> where <math>a,</math> <math>b,</math> and <math>c</math> are [[integer]]s and <math>c</math> is not divisible by the [[square]] of any [[prime]]. Find <math>a+b+c.</math>
