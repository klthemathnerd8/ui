==Simple Solution==
Let $x$ represent the distance from home to the stadium, and let $r$ represent the distance from Yan to home. Our goal is to find $\frac{r}{x-r}$. If Yan walks directly to the stadium, then assuming he walks at a rate of $1$, it will take him $x-r$ units of time. Similarly, if he walks back home it will take him $r + \frac{x}{7}$ units of time. Because the two times are equal, we can create the following equation: $x-r = r + \frac{x}{7}$. We get $x-2r=\frac{x}{7}$, so $\frac{6}{7}x = 2r$, and $\frac{x}{r} = \frac{7}{3}$. This minus one is the reciprocal of what we want to find: $\frac{7}{3}-1 = \frac{4}{3}$, so the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{3}{4}}$
