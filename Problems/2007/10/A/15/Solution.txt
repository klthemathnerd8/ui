==Solution 1==

Draw a square connecting the centers of the four small circles of radius $1$. This square has a diagonal of length $6$, as it includes the diameter of the big circle of radius $2$ and two radii of the small circles of radius $1$. Therefore, the side length of this square is $$\frac{6}{\sqrt{2}} = 3\sqrt{2}.$$ The side length of the larger square is $2$ units greater than the one found by connecting the midpoints, so its side length is $$2 + 3\sqrt{2}.$$ The area of the larger square is $(2+3\sqrt{2})^2 = 22 + 12\sqrt{2}$ $(B).$
