Tom's age $N$ years ago was $T-N$. The sum of the ages of his three children $N$ years ago was $T-3N,$ since there are three children. If his age $N$ years ago was twice the sum of the children's ages then,
$$\begin{align*}T-N&=2(T-3N)\\
T-N&=2T-6N\\
T&=5N\\
T/N&=\boxed{\mathrm{(D) \ } 5}\end{align*}$$
