You can find the area of half the intersection by subtracting the isosceles triangle in the sector from the whole sector. This sector is one-fourth of the area of the circle with radius $2,$ and the isosceles triangle is a right triangle. Therefore, the area of half the intersection is
$$\frac{1}{4} 4\pi - \frac{1}{2}(2)(2) = \pi - 2$$
That means the area of the whole intersection is $\boxed{\mathrm{(D) \ } 2(\pi-2)}$
