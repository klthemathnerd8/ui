Note that if $a$ is positive, then, the equation will have no solutions for $b$. This becomes more obvious by noting that at $a=1$, $ab^2 > \log_{10} b$. The LHS quadratic function will increase faster than the RHS logarithmic function, so they will never intersect.

This puts $a$ as the smallest in the set since it must be negative.

Checking the new equation: $-b^2 = \log_{10}b$

Near $b=0$, $-b^2 > \log_{10} b$ but at $b=1$, $-b^2 < \log_{10} b$

This implies that the solution occurs somewhere in between: $0 < b < 1$

This also implies that $\frac{1}{b} > 1$

This makes our set (ordered)
$\{a,0,b,1,1/b\}$

The median is $b \Rightarrow \mathrm {(D)}$
