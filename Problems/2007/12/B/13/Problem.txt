== Problem ==
A traffic light runs repeatedly through the following cycle: green for $30$ seconds, then yellow for $3$ seconds, and then red for $30$ seconds. Leah picks a random three-second time interval to watch the light. What is the probability that the color changes while she is watching?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac{1}{63} \qquad \mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{1}{21} \qquad \mathrm{(C)}\ \frac{1}{10} \qquad \mathrm{(D)}\ \frac{1}{7} \qquad \mathrm{(E)}\ \frac{1}{3}$
