== Solution ==
The traffic light runs through a $63$ second cycle.

Letting $t=0$ reference the moment it turns green, the light changes at three different times: $t=30$, $t=33$, and $t=63$

This means that the light will change if the beginning of Leah's interval lies in
$[27,30]$, $[30,33]$ or $[60,63]$

This gives a total of $9$ seconds out of $63$

$\frac{9}{63} = \frac{1}{7} \Rightarrow \mathrm{(D)}$
