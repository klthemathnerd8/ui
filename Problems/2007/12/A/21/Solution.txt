== Solution ==
By [[Vieta's formulas]], the sum of the roots of a [[quadratic equation]] is $\frac {-b}a$,  the product of the zeros is $\frac ca$, and the sum of the coefficients is $a + b + c$. Setting equal the first two tells us that $\frac {-b}{a} = \frac ca \Rightarrow b = -c$. Thus, $a + b + c = a + b - b = a$, so the common value is also equal to the coefficient of $x^2 \Longrightarrow \fbox{\textrm{A}}$. 

To disprove the others, note that:
*$\mathrm{B}$: then $b = \frac {-b}a$, which is not necessarily true.
*$\mathrm{C}$: the y-intercept is $c$, so $c = \frac ca$, not necessarily true.
*$\mathrm{D}$: an x-intercept of the graph is a root of the polynomial, but this excludes the other root.
*$\mathrm{E}$: the mean of the x-intercepts will be the sum of the roots of the quadratic divided by 2.
