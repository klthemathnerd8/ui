If $45$ is expressed as a product of five distinct integer factors, the absolute value of the product of any four is at least $ |(-3)(-1)(1)(3)|=9$, so no factor can have an absolute value greater than $5$. Thus the factors of the given expression are five of the integers $\pm 3, \pm 1, \pm 5$. The product of all six of these is $-225=(-5)(45)$, so the factors are $-3, -1, 1, 3,$ and $5.$ The corresponding values of $a, b, c, d,$ and $e$ are $9, 7, 5, 3,$ and $1,$ and their sum is $\fbox{25 (C)}$
