Since the sides of a [[regular polygon]] are equal in length, we can call each side $x$. Examine one edge of the unit cube: each contains two slanted diagonal edges of an octagon and one straight edge. The diagonal edges form $45-45-90 \triangle$ [[right triangle]]s, making the distance on the edge of the cube $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}$. Thus, $2 \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} + x = 1$, and $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{\sqrt{2} - 1}\right) = \sqrt{2} - 1$. 

Each of the cut off corners is a [[pyramid]], whose volume can be calculated by $V = \frac 13 Bh$. Use the base as one of the three [[congruency (geometry)|congruent]] [[isosceles triangle]]s, with the height being one of the edges of the pyramid that sits on the edges of the cube. The height is $\frac x{\sqrt{2}} = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. The base is a $45-45-90 \triangle$ with leg of length $1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, making its area $\frac 12\left(1 - \frac 1{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}4$. Plugging this in, we get that the volume of one of the tetrahedra is $\frac 13 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}4\right) = \frac{10 - 7\sqrt{2}}{24}$. Since there are 8 removed corners, we get an answer of $\frac{10 - 7\sqrt{2}}{3} \Longrightarrow \boxed{\mathrm{B}}$
