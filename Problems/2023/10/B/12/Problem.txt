When the roots of the polynomial 

$$P(x)  = (x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 \cdot \cdot \cdot (x-10)^{10}$$

are removed from the number line, what remains is the union of $11$ disjoint open intervals. On how many of these intervals is $P(x)$ positive?

$\textbf{(A)}~3\qquad\textbf{(B)}~7\qquad\textbf{(C)}~6\qquad\textbf{(D)}~4\qquad\textbf{(E)}~5$
