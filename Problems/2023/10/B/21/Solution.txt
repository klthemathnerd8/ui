==Important Clarification==
Stars and Bars does not provide an exact probability. However, it does provide a good estimate for the approximate answer as on average, the number of arrangements will be almost the same when each container has an odd # of balls or when each container has an even # of balls. (similar binomial distributions)


The above clarification is a good explanation of why the stars and bars argument still yields an expression sufficiently closed to $\frac{1}{4}$. However, I think the content of this clarification should be clearly explained WITHIN any stars and bars solution. Even with this clarification, this page is currently a redundant mess of poorly explained fakesolves:

Solutions 1 and 2 both use stars and bars to arrive at an incorrect probability and fail to explain why their method is a good approximation of the actual probability.

The explanation in solution 4 does not make sense at all.

The nature of this problem makes it so that pretty much any approach will arrive at an answer close to $\frac{1}{4}$. However, I'm concerned that the current state of this page will make most readers come away with a worsened understanding of the structure of the problem, especially since the first two solutions are both fakesolves. This page should be fixed ASAP.

Please don't delete this message without addressing any of my concerns. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. ~ CT17

(Solution 5 by Dissmo does a very good job at explaining Solution 4.)
