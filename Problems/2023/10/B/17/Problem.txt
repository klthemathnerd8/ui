A rectangular box $P$ has distinct edge lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$. The sum of the lengths of all $12$ edges of $P$ is $13$, the areas of all $6$ faces of $P$ is $\frac{11}{2}$, and the volume of $P$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. What is the length of the longest interior diagonal connecting two vertices of $P$?

$\textbf{(A)}~2\qquad\textbf{(B)}~\frac{3}{8}\qquad\textbf{(C)}~\frac{9}{8}\qquad\textbf{(D)}~\frac{9}{4}\qquad\textbf{(E)}~\frac{3}{2}$
