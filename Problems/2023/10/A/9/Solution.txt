==Solution 1 (Casework)==
Do careful casework by each month. In the month and the date, we need a $0$, a $3$, and two digits repeated (which has to be $1$ and $2$ after consideration). After the casework, we get $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}~9}$.
For curious readers, the numbers (in chronological order) are:

 20230113
 20230131
 20230223
 20230311
 20230322
 20231013
 20231031
 20231103
