Let $K$ be the number of sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\dots$, $A_n$ such that $n$ is a positive integer less than or equal to $10$, each $A_i$ is a subset of $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, 10\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive. For example, $\{\}$, $\{5, 7\}$, $\{2, 5, 7\}$, $\{2, 5, 7\}$, $\{2, 5, 6, 7, 9\}$ is one such sequence, with $n = 5$.What is the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$?

$\textbf{(A) } 1 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 3 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 5 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 7 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 9$
