A regular pentagon with area $\sqrt{5}+1$ is printed on paper and cut out. The five vertices of the pentagon are folded into the center of the pentagon, creating a smaller pentagon. What is the area of the new pentagon?

$\textbf{(A)}~4-\sqrt{5}\qquad\textbf{(B)}~\sqrt{5}-1\qquad\textbf{(C)}~8-3\sqrt{5}\qquad\textbf{(D)}~\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(E)}~\frac{2+\sqrt{5}}{3}$
