==Solution 1 (easy)==
We can create the equation:
$$0.8x \cdot 1.075 = 43$$
using the information given. This is because x, the original price, got reduced by 20%, or multiplied by 0.8, and it also got multiplied by 1.075 on the discounted price. Solving that equation, we get
$$\frac{4}{5} \cdot x \cdot \frac{43}{40} = 43$$
$$\frac{4}{5} \cdot x \cdot \frac{1}{40} = 1$$
$$\frac{1}{5} \cdot x \cdot \frac{1}{10} = 1$$
$$x  = \boxed{50}$$
