==Solution 1==
There is no way to have a set with 0. If a set is to have its lowest element as 1, it must have only 1 element: 1. If a set is to have its lowest element as 2, it must have 2, and the other element will be chosen from the natural numbers between 3 and 12, inclusive. To calculate this, we do $\binom{10}{1}$. If the set is the have its lowest element as 3, the other 2 elements will be chosen from the natural numbers between 4 and 12, inclusive. To calculate this, we do $\binom{9}{2}$. We can see a pattern emerge, where the top is decreasing by 1 and the bottom is increasing by 1. In other words, we have to add $1 + \binom{10}{1} + \binom{9}{2} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{7}{4} + \binom{6}{5}$. This is $1+10+36+56+35+6 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) 144}}$.
