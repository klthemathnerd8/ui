==Solution 1==
The first three glasses each have a full glass.  Let's assume that each glass has "1 unit" of juice. It won't matter exactly how much juice everyone has because we're dealing with ratios, and that wouldn't affect our answer. The fourth glass has a glass that is one third. So the total amount of juice will be $1+1+1+\dfrac{1}{3} = \dfrac{10}{3}$. If we divide the total amount of juice by 4, we get $\dfrac{5}{6}$, which should be the amount of juice in each glass. This means that each of the first three glasses will have to contribute $1 - \dfrac{5}{6} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}$ to the fourth glass.
