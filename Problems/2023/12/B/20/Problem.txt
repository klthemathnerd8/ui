Cyrus the frog jumps $2$ units in a direction, then $2$ more in another direction. What is the probability that he lands less than $1$ unit away from his starting position?

$\textbf{(A)}~\frac{1}{6}\qquad\textbf{(B)}~\frac{1}{5}\qquad\textbf{(C)}~\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\qquad\textbf{(D)}~\frac{\arctan \frac{1}{2}}{\pi}\qquad\textbf{(E)}~\frac{2\arcsin \frac{1}{4}}{\pi}$
