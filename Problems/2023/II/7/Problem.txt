==Problem==

Each vertex of a regular dodecagon (<math>12</math>-gon) is to be colored either red or blue, and thus there are <math>2^{12}</math> possible colorings. Find the number of these colorings with the property that no four vertices colored the same color are the four vertices of a rectangle.
