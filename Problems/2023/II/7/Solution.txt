== Solution 1==

Note that the condition is equivalent to stating that there are no 2 pairs of oppositely spaced vertices with the same color.

Case 1: There are no pairs. This yields <math>2</math> options for each vertices 1-6, and the remaining vertices 7-12 are set, yielding <math>2^6=64</math> cases.

Case 2: There is one pair. Again start with 2 options for each vertex in 1-6, but now multiply by 6 since there are 6 possibilities for which pair can have the same color assigned instead of the opposite. Thus, the cases are: <math>2^6*6=384</math>

case 3: There are two pairs, but oppositely colored. Start with <math>2^6</math> for assigning 1-6, then multiply by 6C2=15 for assigning which have repeated colors. Divide by 2 due to half the cases having the same colored opposites. <math>2^6*15/2=480</math>

It is apparent that no other cases exist, as more pairs would force there to be 2 pairs of same colored oppositely spaced vertices with the same color. Thus, the answer is: <math>64+384+480=\boxed{928}</math>
