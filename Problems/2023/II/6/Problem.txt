Consider the L-shaped region formed by three unit squares joined at their sides, as shown below. Two points <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are chosen independently and uniformly at random from inside the region. The probability that the midpoint of <math>\overline{AB}</math> also lies inside this L-shaped region can be expressed as <math>\frac{m}{n},</math> where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are relatively prime positive integers. Find <math>m+n.</math>
