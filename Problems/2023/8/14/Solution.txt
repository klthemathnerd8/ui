==Solution 1==

Let's use the most stamps to make $7.10.$ We have $20$ of each stamp, $5$-cent (nickels), $10$-cent (dimes), and $25$-cent (quarters).

If we want the highest number of stamps, we must have the highest number of the smaller value stamps (like the coins above). We can use $20$ nickels and $20$ dimes to bring our total cost to $7.10 - 3.00 = 4.10$. However, when we try to use quarters, the $25$ cents donâ€™t fit evenly, so we have to give back $15$ cents to make the quarter amount $4.25$. The most efficient way to do this is to give back a  $10$-cent (dime) stamp and a $5$-cent (nickel) stamp to have $38$ stamps used so far. Now, we just use $\frac{425}{25} = 17$ quarters to get a grand total of $38 + 17 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 55}$.
