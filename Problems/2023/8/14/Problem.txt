==Problem==
Nicolas is planning to send a package to his friend Anton, who is a stamp collector. To pay for the postage, Nicolas would like to cover the package with a large number of stamps. Suppose he has a collection of $5$-cent, $10$-cent, and $25$-cent stamps, with exactly $20$ of each type. What is the greatest number of stamps Nicolas can use to make exactly $\$7.10$ in postage?
(Note: The amount $\$7.10$ corresponds to $7$ dollars and $10$ cents. One dollar is worth $100$ cents.)

$\textbf{(A)}\ 45 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 46 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 51 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 54\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 55$
