==Problem==
Alina writes the numbers $1, 2, \dots , 9$ on separate cards, one number per card. She wishes to divide the cards into $3$ groups of $3$ cards so that the sum of the numbers in each group will be the same. In how many ways can this be done?

$\textbf{(A) } 0 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 1 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 2 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 3 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 4$
