Notice that when we unfold the paper along the vertical fold line, we get the following shape:


<asy>

size(90);
path sq = (-0.5,0)--(0.5,0)--(0.5,0.5)--(-0.5,0.5)--cycle;
path trE = (-0.25,0)--(0.25,0)--(0,0.25)--cycle;

real sh = 1.5;
filldraw(shift((sh,-sh))*sq,mediumgrey,black);
filldraw(shift((sh,-sh))*trE,white,black);

size(90);
path sq = (-0.5,-0.5)--(0.5,-0.5)--(0.5,0.5)--(-0.5,0.5)--cycle;
path sqE = (-0.25,0)--(0,-0.25)--(0.25,0)--(0,0.25)--cycle;

real sh = 1.5;
filldraw(shift((sh,-sh))*sq,mediumgrey,black);
filldraw(shift((sh,-sh))*sqE,white,black);
</asy>

It is clear that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}}$.
