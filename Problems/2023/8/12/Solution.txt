==Solution 1==
First, the total area of the radius $3$ circle is simply just $9* \pi$ when using our area of a circle formula. 

Now from here, we have to find our shaded area. This can be done by adding the areas of the $3$ $\frac{1}{2}$-radius circles and add; then, take the area of the $2$ radius circle and subtract that from the area of the $2$ radius 1 circles to get our resulting complex area shape. Adding these up, we will get $3 * \frac{1}{4} \pi + 4 \pi -\pi - \pi = \frac{3}{4} \pi + 2 \pi = \frac{11 * \pi}{4}$.

So, our answer is $\frac {\frac{11}{4} \pi}{9 \pi} = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{11}{36}}$.
