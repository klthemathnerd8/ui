== Solution 1== 
If we start off with the first digit, we know that it can't be $9$ since $9$ is not a factor of $120$. We go down to the digit $8$, which does work since it is a factor of $120$. Now, we have to know what digits will take up the remaining four spots. To find this result, just divide $\frac{120}{8}=15$. The next place can be $5$, as it is the largest factor, aside from $15$. Consequently, our next three values will be $3,1$ and $1$ if we use the same logic. Therefore, our five-digit number is $85311$, so the sum is $8+5+3+1+1=18\implies \boxed{\textbf{(D) }18}$.
