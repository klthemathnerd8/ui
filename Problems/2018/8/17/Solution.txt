==Solution 1 (Fast and Easy)==
Every 10 feet Bella goes, Ella goes 50 feet, which means a total of 60 feet. They need to travel that 60 feet $10560\div60=176$ times to travel the entire 2 miles. Since Bella goes 10 feet 176 times, this means that she travels a total of 1760 feet. And since she walks 2.5 feet each step, $1760\div2.5=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }704}$
