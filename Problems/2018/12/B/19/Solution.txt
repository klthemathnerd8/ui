Let $d$ be the next divisor written to the right of $323.$

If $\gcd(323,d)=1,$ then $$n\geq323d>323^2>100^2=10000,$$ which contradicts the precondition that $n$ is a $4$-digit number.

It follows that $\gcd(323,d)>1.$ Since $323=17\cdot19,$ the smallest possible value of $d$ is $17\cdot20=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 340},$ from which $$n=\operatorname{lcm}(323,d)=17\cdot19\cdot20=6460.$$
