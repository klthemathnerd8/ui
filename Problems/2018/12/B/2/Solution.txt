== Solution 1 ==
Suppose that Sam's average speed during the last $30$ minutes was $x$ mph.

Recall that a half hour is equal to $30$ minutes. Therefore, Sam drove $60\cdot0.5=30$ miles during the first half hour, $65\cdot0.5=32.5$ miles during the second half hour, and $x\cdot0.5$ miles during the last half hour. We have $$\begin{align*}
30+32.5+x\cdot0.5&=96 \\
x\cdot0.5&=33.5 \\
x&=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 67}.
\end{align*}$$
