On the interval $[0, \pi]$ sine is nonnegative; thus $\sin(x + y) = \sin x \cos y + \sin y \cos x \le \sin x + \sin y$ for all $x, y \in [0, \pi]$ and equality only occurs when $\cos x = \cos y = 1$, which is cosine's maximum value. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 0\le y\le \pi}$. (CantonMathGuy)
