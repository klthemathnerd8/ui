== Solution 1 ==
For each <math>k</math> between <math>2</math> and <math>2450</math>, the area of the trapezoid with <math>\overline{P_kQ_k}</math> as its bottom base is the difference between the areas of two triangles, both similar to <math>\triangle{ABC}</math>. Let <math>d_k</math> be the length of segment <math>\overline{P_kQ_k}</math>. The area of the trapezoid with bases <math>\overline{P_{k-1}Q_{k-1}}</math> and <math>P_kQ_k</math> is <math>\left(\frac{d_k}{5\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{d_{k-1}}{5\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{d_k^2-d_{k-1}^2}{75}</math> times the area of <math>\triangle{ABC}</math>. (This logic also applies to the topmost triangle if we notice that <math>d_0 = 0</math>.) However, we also know that the area of each shape is <math>\frac{1}{2450}</math> times the area of <math>\triangle{ABC}</math>. We then have <math>\frac{d_k^2-d_{k-1}^2}{75} = \frac{1}{2450}</math>. Simplifying, <math>d_k^2-d_{k-1}^2 = \frac{3}{98}</math>. However, we know that <math>d_0^2 = 0</math>, so <math>d_1^2 = \frac{3}{98}</math>, and in general, <math>d_k^2 = \frac{3k}{98}</math> and <math>d_k = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{3k}{2}}}{7}</math>. The smallest <math>k</math> that gives a rational <math>d_k</math> is <math>6</math>, so <math>d_k</math> is rational if and only if <math>k = 6n^2</math> for some integer <math>n</math>.The largest <math>n</math> such that <math>6n^2</math> is less than <math>2450</math> is <math>20</math>, so <math>k</math> has <math>\boxed{020}</math> possible values.
