==Problem==

A frog is positioned at the origin of the coordinate plane. From the point <math>(x, y)</math>, the frog can jump to any of the points <math>(x + 1, y)</math>, <math>(x + 2, y)</math>, <math>(x, y + 1)</math>, or <math>(x, y + 2)</math>. Find the number of distinct sequences of jumps in which the frog begins at <math>(0, 0)</math> and ends at <math>(4, 4)</math>.
