==Problem==

Points <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, and <math>C</math> lie in that order along a straight path where the distance from <math>A</math> to <math>C</math> is <math>1800</math> meters. Ina runs twice as fast as Eve, and Paul runs twice as fast as Ina. The three runners start running at the same time with Ina starting at <math>A</math> and running toward <math>C</math>, Paul starting at <math>B</math> and running toward <math>C</math>, and Eve starting at <math>C</math> and running toward <math>A</math>. When Paul meets Eve, he turns around and runs toward <math>A</math>. Paul and Ina both arrive at <math>B</math> at the same time. Find the number of meters from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math>.
