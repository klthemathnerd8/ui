==Problem 15==
David found four sticks of different lengths that can be used to form three non-congruent convex cyclic quadrilaterals, <math>A,\text{ }B,\text{ }C</math>, which can each be inscribed in a circle with radius <math>1</math>. Let <math>\varphi_A</math> denote the measure of the acute angle made by the diagonals of quadrilateral <math>A</math>, and define <math>\varphi_B</math> and <math>\varphi_C</math> similarly. Suppose that <math>\sin\varphi_A=\tfrac{2}{3}</math>, <math>\sin\varphi_B=\tfrac{3}{5}</math>, and <math>\sin\varphi_C=\tfrac{6}{7}</math>. All three quadrilaterals have the same area <math>K</math>, which can be written in the form <math>\dfrac{m}{n}</math>, where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are relatively prime positive integers. Find <math>m+n</math>.
