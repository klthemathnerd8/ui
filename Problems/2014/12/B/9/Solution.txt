Note that by the pythagorean theorem, $AC=5$.  Also note that $\angle CAD$ is a right angle because $\triangle CAD$ is a right triangle.  The area of the quadrilateral is the sum of the areas of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle CAD$ which is equal to 
$$\frac{3\times4}{2} + \frac{5\times12}{2} = 6 + 30 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 36}$$
