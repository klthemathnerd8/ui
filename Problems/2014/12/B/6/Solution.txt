==Solution==
Let the size of Ed's drink equal $x$ ounces, and let the size of Ann's drink equal $\frac{3}{2}x$ ounces.  After both consume $\frac{3}{4}$ of their drinks, Ed and Ann have $\frac{x}{4}$  and $\frac{3x}{8}$ ounces of their drinks remaining.  Ann gives away $\frac{x}{8} + 2$ ounces to Ed.

In the end, Ed drank everything in his original lemonade plus what Ann gave him, and Ann drank everything in her original lemonade minus what she gave Ed. Thus we have
$$x + \frac{x}{8} + 2 = \frac{3x}{2} - \frac{x}{8} - 2$$
$$x = 16$$
The total amount the two of them drank is simply 
$$x + \frac{3}{2}x = 16 + 24 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 40}$$
