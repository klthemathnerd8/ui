===Solution 1===
We know that $n \le 30$ or else $30-n$ will be negative, resulting in a negative fraction.  We also know that $n \ge 15$ or else the fraction's denominator will exceed its numerator making the fraction unable to equal a positive integer value.  Substituting all values $n$ from $15$ to $30$ gives us integer values for $n=15, 20, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29$.  Counting them up, we have $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7}$ possible values for $n$.  

===Solution 2===
Let $ \frac{n}{30-n}=m $, where $ m \in \mathbb{N} $. Solving for $ n $, we find that $ n=\frac{30m}{m+1} $. Because $ m $ and $ m+1 $ are relatively prime, $ m+1|30 $. Our answer is the number of proper divisors of $ 2^13^15^1 $, which is $ (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)-1 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7} $.
