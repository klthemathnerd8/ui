==Solution==
Let $P(x) = Ax^3+Bx^2 + Cx+D$.   Plugging in $0$ for $x$, we find $D=k$, and plugging in $1$ and $-1$ for $x$, we obtain the following equations:
$$A+B+C+k=2k$$
$$-A+B-C+k=3k$$
Adding these two equations together, we get
$$2B=3k $$
If we plug in $2$ and $-2$ in for $x$, we find that 
$$P(2)+P(-2) = 8A+4B+2C+k+(-8A+4B-2C+k)=8B+2k$$
Multiplying the third equation by $4$ and adding $2k$ gives us our desired result, so 
$$P(2)+P(-2)=12k+2k=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 14k}$$
