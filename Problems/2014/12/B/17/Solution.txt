==Solution 1 (Algebra Based)==
Let $y = m(x - 20) + 14$. Equating them:

$x^2 = mx - 20m + 14$

$x^2 - mx + 20m - 14 = 0$

For there to be no solutions, the discriminant must be less than zero:

$m^2 - 4(20m - 14) < 0$

$m^2 - 80m + 56 < 0$.

So $m < 0$ for $r < m < s$ where $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $m^2 - 80m + 56 = 0$ and their sum by Vieta's formulas is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 80}$.
