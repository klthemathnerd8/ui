==Solution 1==

If every balloon costs $n$ dollars, then Orvin has $30n$ dollars.  For every balloon he buys for $n$ dollars, he can buy another for $ \frac{2n}{3}$ dollars.  This means it costs him $ \frac{5n}{3}$ dollars to buy a bundle of $2$ balloons.  With $30n$ dollars, he can buy $\frac{30n}{\frac{5n}{3}} = 18$ sets of two balloons, so the total number of balloons he can buy is $18\times2  \implies \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 36 }$
