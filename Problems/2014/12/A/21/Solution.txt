Let $\lfloor x\rfloor=k$ for some integer $1\leq k\leq 2013$.  Then we can rewrite $f(x)$ as $k(2014^{x-k}-1)$.  In order for this to be less than or equal to $1$, we need $2014^{x-k}-1\leq\dfrac1k\implies x\leq k+\log_{2014}\left(\dfrac{k+1}k\right)$.  Combining this with the fact that $\lfloor x\rfloor =k$ gives that $x\in\left[k,k+\log_{2014}\left(\dfrac{k+1}k\right)\right]$, and so the length of the interval is $\log_{2014}\left(\dfrac{k+1}k\right)$.  We want the sum of all possible intervals such that the inequality holds true; since all of these intervals must be disjoint, we can sum from $k=1$ to $k=2013$ to get that the desired sum is $$\sum_{i=1}^{2013}\log_{2014}\left(\dfrac{i+1}i\right)=\log_{2014}\left(\prod_{i=1}^{2013}\dfrac{i+1}i\right)=\log_{2014}\left(\dfrac{2014}1\right)=\boxed{1\textbf{ (A)}}.$$
