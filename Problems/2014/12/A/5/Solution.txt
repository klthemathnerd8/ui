==Solution 1==
Without loss of generality, let there be $20$ students (the least whole number possible) who took the test. We have $2$ students score $70$ points, $7$ students score $80$ points, $6$ students score $90$ points and $5$ students score $100$ points. Therefore, the mean
is $87$ and the median is $90$.

Thus, the solution is $$90-87=3\implies\boxed{\textbf{(C)} \ 3}$$
