== Solution 1==
Factor the quadratic into
$$ \left(5x + \frac{12}{n}\right)\left(x + n\right) = 0 $$
where $-n$ is our integer solution. Then, 
$$ k = \frac{12}{n} + 5n, $$
which takes rational values between $-200$ and $200$ when $|n| \leq 39$, excluding $n = 0$. This leads to an answer of $2 \cdot 39 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 78}$.
