== Problem 4 ==
Jon and Steve ride their bicycles along a path that parallels two side-by-side train tracks running the east/west direction. Jon rides east at <math>20</math> miles per hour, and Steve rides west at <math>20</math> miles per hour. Two trains of equal length, traveling in opposite directions at constant but different speeds each pass the two riders. Each train takes exactly <math>1</math> minute to go past Jon. The westbound train takes <math>10</math> times as long as the eastbound train to go past Steve. The length of each train is <math>\tfrac{m}{n}</math> miles, where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are relatively prime positive integers. Find <math>m+n</math>.
