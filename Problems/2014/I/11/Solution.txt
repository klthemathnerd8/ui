== Solution 1 (Slick Solution) ==
Perform the coordinate transformation <math>(x, y)\rightarrow (x+y, x-y)</math>. Then we can see that a movement up, right, left, or down in the old coordinates adds the vectors <math>\langle 1, -1 \rangle</math>, <math>\langle 1, 1 \rangle</math>, <math>\langle -1, -1 \rangle</math>, <math>\langle -1, 1 \rangle</math> respectively. Moreover, the transformation takes the equation <math>|y| = |x|</math> to the union of the x and y axis. Exactly half of the moves go up in the new coordinates, and half of them go down. In order to end up on the x axis, we need to go up thrice and down thrice. The number of possible sequences of up and down moves is the number of permutations of <math>UUUDDD</math>, which is just <math>\binom63 = 20</math>. The probability of any of these sequences happening is <math>\left(\frac12\right)^6</math>. Thus, the probability of ending on the x axis is <math>\frac{20}{2^6}</math>. Similarly, the probability of ending on the y axis is the same. 

However, we overcount exactly one case: ending at <math>(0, 0)</math>. Since ending on the x axis and ending on the y axis are independent events, the probability of both is simply <math>\left(\frac{20}{2^6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{256}</math>. Using PIE, the total probability is <math>\frac{20}{64} + \frac{20}{64} - \frac{25}{256} = \frac{135}{256}</math>, giving an answer of <math>\boxed{391}</math>.
