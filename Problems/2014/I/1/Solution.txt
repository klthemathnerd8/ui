The rectangle is divided into three smaller rectangles with a width of 50 mm and a length of <math>\dfrac{80}{3}</math>mm.  According to the Pythagorean Theorem (or by noticing the 8-15-17 Pythagorean triple), the diagonal of the rectangle is
<math>\sqrt{50^2+\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2}=\frac{170}{3}</math>mm.  Since that on the lace, there are 6 of these diagonals, a width, and an extension of at least 200 mm on each side.  Therefore, the minimum of the lace in millimeters is
<cmath>6\times \dfrac{170}{3}+50+200\times 2=\boxed{790}.</cmath>
