By looking at the problem and drawing a few pictures, it quickly becomes obvious that one cannot draw a circle that covers <math>2</math> disjoint areas of the <math>12</math>-gon without including all the vertices in between those areas. In other words, in order for a subset to be communal, all the vertices in the subset must be adjacent to one another. We now count the number of ways to select a row of adjacent vertices. We notice that for any subset size between <math>1</math> and <math>11</math>, there are <math>12</math> possible subsets like this (this is true because we can pick any of the <math>12</math> vertices as a "starting" vertex, include some number of vertices counterclockwise from that vertex, and generate all possible configurations). However, we also have to include the set of all <math>12</math> vertices, as well as the empty set. Thus, the total number is <math>12\cdot11 + 2 = \boxed{134}</math>.
