==Solution 1==

We note that the $6$ triangular sections in $\triangle{ABC}$ can be put together to form a hexagon congruent to each of the seven other hexagons. By the formula for the area of the hexagon, we get the area for each hexagon as $\dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The area of $\triangle{ABC}$, which is equivalent to two of these hexagons together, is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}  3\sqrt{3}}$.
