==Solution 1==
Let the original price be $x$. Then, for option $1$, the discounted price is $(1-.15)(1-.15)x = .7225x$. For option $2$, the discounted price is $(1-.1)(1-.1)(1-.1)x = .729x$. Finally, for option $3$, the discounted price is $(1-.25)(1-.05) = .7125x$. Therefore, $n$ must be greater than $\max(x - .7225x, x-.729x, x-.7125x)$. It follows $n/100$ must be greater than $.2875$. We multiply this by $100$ to get the percent value, and then round up because $n$ is the smallest integer that provides a greater discount than $28.75$, leaving us with the answer of $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 29}$
