==Solution==
She first sells one-half of her $48$ loaves, or $\frac{48}{2}=24$ loaves. Each loaf sells for $\textdollar 2.50$, so her total earnings in the morning is equal to $$24\cdot \textdollar 2.50 = \textdollar 60$$

This leaves 24 loaves left, and Bridget will sell $\dfrac{2}{3}\times 24=16$ of them for a price of $\textdollar\frac{2.50}{2}=\textdollar 1.25$. Thus, her total earnings for the afternoon is $$16\cdot \textdollar 1.25  = \textdollar 20$$

Finally, Bridget will sell the remaining $24-16=8$ loaves for a dollar each. This is a total of $\textdollar 1\cdot 8 = \textdollar 8$

The total amount of money she makes is equal to $60+20+8=\textdollar 88$.

However, since Bridget spends $\textdollar 0.75$ making each loaf of bread, the total cost to make the bread is equal to  $\textdollar 0.75\cdot48=\textdollar 36$.

Her total profit is the amount of money she spent subtracted from the amount of money she made, which is $$88-36=52\implies\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \ 52}$$
