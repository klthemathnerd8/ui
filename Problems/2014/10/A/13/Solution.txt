==Solution 1==
The area of the equilateral triangle is $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$. The area of the three squares is $3\times 1=3$.

Since $\angle C=360$, $\angle GCH=360-90-90-60=120$.

Dropping an altitude from $C$ to $GH$ allows to create a $30-60-90$ triangle since $\triangle GCH$ is isosceles. This means that the height of $\triangle GCH$ is $\dfrac{1}{2}$ and half the length of $GH$ is $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, the area of each isosceles triangle is $\dfrac{1}{2}\times\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}=\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Multiplying by $3$ yields $\dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}$ for all three isosceles triangles.

Therefore, the total area is $3+\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{4}+\dfrac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}=3+\dfrac{4\sqrt{3}}{4}=3+\sqrt{3}\implies\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 3+\sqrt3}$.
