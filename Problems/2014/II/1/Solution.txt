From the given information, we can see that Abe can paint <math>\frac{1}{15}</math> of the room in an hour, Bea can paint <math>\frac{1}{15}\times\frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{10}</math> of the room in an hour, and Coe can paint the room in <math>\frac{1}{15}\times 2 = \frac{2}{15}</math> of the room in an hour.  After <math>90</math> minutes, Abe has painted <math>\frac{1}{15}\times\frac{3}{2}=\frac{1}{10}</math> of the room.  Working together, Abe and Bea can paint <math>\frac{1}{15}+\frac{1}{10}=\frac{1}{6}</math> of the room in an hour, so it takes then <math>\frac{2}{5}\div \frac{1}{6}= \frac{12}{5}</math> hours to finish the first half of the room.  All three working together can paint <math>\frac{1}{6}+\frac{2}{15}=\frac{3}{10}</math> of the room in an hour, and it takes them <math>\frac{1}{2}\div \frac{3}{10}=\frac{5}{3}</math> hours to finish the room.  The total amount of time they take is
<cmath>90+\frac{12}{5}\times 60+\frac{5}{3}\times 60 = 90+ 144 + 100 = \boxed{334} \text{\ minutes.}</cmath>
