==Solution 1==
Let's call the celebrities A, B, and C. 
There is a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance that celebrity A's picture will be selected, and a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance that his baby picture will be selected. That means there are two celebrities left. There is now a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance that celebrity B's picture will be selected, and another $\frac{1}{2}$ chance that his baby picture will be selected. This leaves a $\frac{1}{1}$ chance for the last celebrity, so the total probability is $\frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{36}$. However, the order of the celebrities doesn't matter, so the final probability will be $ 3!\cdot \frac{1}{36}=\boxed{\text{(B) }\dfrac{1}{6}}.$
