==Problem==
A magazine printed photos of three celebrities along with three photos of the celebrities as babies. The baby pictures did not identify the celebrities. Readers were asked to match each celebrity with the correct baby pictures. What is the probability that a reader guessing at random will match all three correctly? 

$ \textbf{(A) }\frac{1}{9}\qquad\textbf{(B) }\frac{1}{6}\qquad\textbf{(C) }\frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(D) }\frac{1}{3}\qquad\textbf{(E) }\frac{1}{2} $
