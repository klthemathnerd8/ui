==Problem==
Three members of the Euclid Middle School girls' softball team had the following conversation.

Ashley: I just realized that our uniform numbers are all $2$-digit primes.

Bethany : And the sum of your two uniform numbers is the date of my birthday earlier this month.

Caitlin: That's funny. The sum of your two uniform numbers is the date of my birthday later this month.

Ashley: And the sum of your two uniform numbers is today's date.

What number does Caitlin wear?

$\textbf{(A) }11\qquad\textbf{(B) }13\qquad\textbf{(C) }17\qquad\textbf{(D) }19\qquad \textbf{(E) }23$
