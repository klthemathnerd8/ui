==Solution 1==
We'll just start by breaking cases down. The probability of A occurring is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}$. The probability of B occurring is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}$.

The probability of C occurring is $\dbinom{4}{2}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{3}{8}$, because we need to choose 2 of the 4 slots to be girls. 

For D, there are two possible cases, 3 girls and 1 boy or 3 boys and 1 girl. The probability of the first case is $\dbinom{4}{1}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{4}$ because we need to choose 1 of the 4 slots to be a boy. However, the second case has the same probability because we are choosing 1 of the 4 children to be a girl, so the total probability is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{2}$.


So out of the four fractions, D is the largest. So our answer is $\boxed{\text{(D)}}.$
