==Problem==
Two fair dice, each with at least $6$ faces are rolled. On each face of each die is printed a distinct integer from $1$ to the number of faces on that die, inclusive. The probability of rolling a sum of $7$ is $\frac34$ of the probability of rolling a sum of $10,$ and the probability of rolling a sum of $12$ is $\frac{1}{12}$. What is the least possible number of faces on the two dice combined?

$\textbf{(A) }16 \qquad \textbf{(B) }17 \qquad \textbf{(C) }18\qquad \textbf{(D) }19 \qquad \textbf{(E) }20$
