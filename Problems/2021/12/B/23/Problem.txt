Three balls are randomly and independantly tossed into bins numbered with the positive integers so that for each ball, the probability that it is tossed into bin $i$ is $2^{-i}$ for $i=1,2,3,....$ More than one ball is allowed in each bin. The probability that the balls end up evenly spaced in distinct bins is $\frac pq,$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. (For example, the balls are evenly spaced if they are tossed into bins $3,17,$ and $10.$) What is $p+q?$

$\textbf{(A) }55 \qquad \textbf{(B) }56 \qquad \textbf{(C) }57\qquad \textbf{(D) }58 \qquad \textbf{(E) }59$
