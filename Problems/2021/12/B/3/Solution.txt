Subtracting $2$ from both sides and taking reciprocals gives $1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{2}{3+x}}=\frac{53}{38}$. Subtracting $1$ from both sides and taking reciprocals again gives $2+\frac{2}{3+x}=\frac{38}{15}$. Subtracting $2$ from both sides and taking reciprocals for the final time gives $\frac{x+3}{2}=\frac{15}{8}$ or $x=\frac{3}{4} \implies \boxed{\text{A}}$.
