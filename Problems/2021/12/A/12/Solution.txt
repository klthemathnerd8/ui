==Solution 1==
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the six roots is $10$ and the product of the six roots is $16$. By inspection, we see the roots are $1, 1, 2, 2, 2,$ and $2$, so the function is $(z-1)^2(z-2)^4=(z^2-2z+1)(z^4-8z^3+24z^2-32z+16)$. Therefore, calculating just the $z^3$ terms, we get $B = -32 - 48 - 8 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }{-}88}$.
