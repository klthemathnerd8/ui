==Solution 1 (Perpendicular Bisectors)==

The solutions to this equation are $z = 1$, $z = -1 \pm i\sqrt 3$, and $z = -2\pm i\sqrt 2$. Consider the five points $(1,0)$, $\left(-1,\pm\sqrt 3\right)$, and $\left(-2,\pm\sqrt 2\right)$; these are the five points which lie on $\mathcal E$. Note that since these five points are symmetric about the $x$-axis, so must $\mathcal E$.

Now let $r=b/a$ denote the ratio of the length of the minor axis of $\mathcal E$ to the length of its major axis. Remark that if we perform a transformation of the plane which scales every $x$-coordinate by a factor of $r$, $\mathcal E$ is sent to a circle $\mathcal E'$. Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding the value of $r$ such that $(r,0)$, $\left(-r,\pm\sqrt 3\right)$, and $\left(-2r,\pm\sqrt 2\right)$ all lie on a common circle; equivalently, it suffices to determine the value of $r$ such that the circumcenter of the triangle formed by the points $P_1 = (r,0)$, $P_2 = \left(-r,\sqrt 3\right)$, and $P_3 = \left(-2r,\sqrt 2\right)$ lies on the $x$-axis.

Recall that the circumcenter of a triangle $ABC$ is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of its three sides. The equations of the perpendicular bisectors of the segments $\overline{P_1P_2}$ and $\overline{P_1P_3}$ are$$y = \tfrac{\sqrt 3}2 + \tfrac{2r}{\sqrt 3}x\qquad\text{and}\qquad y = \tfrac{\sqrt 2}2 + \tfrac{3r}{\sqrt 2}\left(x + \tfrac r2\right)$$respectively. These two lines have different slopes for $r\neq 0$, so indeed they will intersect at some point $(x_0,y_0)$; we want $y_0 = 0$. Plugging $y = 0$ into the first equation yields $x = -\tfrac{3}{4r}$, and so plugging $y=0$ into the second equation and simplifying yields$$-\tfrac{1}{3r} = x + \tfrac r2 = -\tfrac{3}{4r} + \tfrac{r}{2}.$$Solving yields $r=\sqrt{\tfrac 56}$.

Finally, recall that the lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ (where $c$ is the distance between the foci of $\mathcal E$) satisfy $c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$. Thus the eccentricity of $\mathcal E$ is $\tfrac ca = \sqrt{1 - \left(\tfrac ba\right)^2} = \sqrt{\tfrac 16}$ and the requested answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 7}$.
