==Solution 1 (Algebra)==
If the probability of choosing a red card is $\frac{1}{3}$, the red and black cards are in ratio $1:2$. This means at the beginning there are $x$ red cards and $2x$ black cards.

After $4$ black cards are added, there are $2x+4$ black cards. This time, the probability of choosing a red card is $\frac{1}{4}$ so the ratio of red to black cards is $1:3$. This means in the new deck the number of black cards is also $3x$ for the same $x$ red cards.

So, $3x = 2x + 4$ and $x=4$ meaning there are $4$ red cards in the deck at the start and $2(4) = 8$ black cards. 

So, the answer is $8+4 = 12 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }12}$.
