== Solution 1 ==
In order to attack this problem, we can use casework on the sign of $|x-y|$ and $|x+y|$.

Case 1: $|x-y|=x-y, |x+y|=x+y$

Substituting and simplifying, we have $x^2-6x+y^2=0$, i.e. $(x-3)^2+y^2=3^2$, which gives us a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(3,0)$.

Case 2: $|x-y|=y-x, |x+y|=x+y$

Substituting and simplifying again, we have $x^2+y^2-6y=0$, i.e. $x^2+(y-3)^2=3^2$. This gives us a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(0,3)$.

Case 3: $|x-y|=x-y, |x+y|=-x-y$

Doing the same process as before, we have $x^2+y^2+6y=0$, i.e. $x^2+(y+3)^2=3^2$. This gives us a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(0,-3)$.

Case 4: $|x-y|=y-x, |x+y|=-x-y$

One last time: we have $x^2+y^2+6x=0$, i.e. $(x+3)^2+y^2=3^2$. This gives us a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(-3,0)$.

After combining all the cases and drawing them on the Cartesian Plane, this is what the diagram looks like:

<asy>
size(10cm); 
Label f; 
f.p=fontsize(7);
xaxis(-8,8,Ticks(f, 1.0)); 
yaxis(-8,8,Ticks(f, 1.0)); 
draw(arc((-3,0),3,90,270) -- cycle, gray);
draw(arc((0,3),3,0,180) -- cycle, gray);
draw(arc((3,0),3,-90,90) -- cycle, gray);
draw(arc((0,-3),3,-180,0) -- cycle, gray);
draw((-3,3)--(3,3)--(3,-3)--(-3,-3)--cycle, grey);
</asy>
Now, the area of the shaded region is just a square with side length $6$ with four semicircles of radius $3$.
The area is $6\cdot6+4\cdot \frac{9\pi}{2} = 36+18\pi$. The answer is $36+18$ which is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }54}$
