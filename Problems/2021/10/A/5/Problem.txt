The quiz scores of a class with $k > 12$ students have a mean of $8$. The mean of a collection of $12$ of these quiz scores is $14$. What is the mean of the remaining quiz scores in terms of $k$?

$\textbf{(A)} ~\frac{14-8}{k-12} \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~\frac{8k-168}{k-12} \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~\frac{14}{12} - \frac{8}{k} \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~\frac{14(k-12)}{k^2} \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~\frac{14(k-12)}{8k}$
