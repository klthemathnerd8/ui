==Solution 1==

By multiplying the entire equation by $3-2=1$, all the terms will simplify by difference of squares, and the final answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~3^{128}-2^{128}}$.

Additionally, we could also multiply the entire equation (we can let it be equal to $x$) by $2-3=-1$. The terms again simplify by difference of squares. This time, we get $-x=2^{128}-3^{128} \Rightarrow x=3^{128}-2^{128}$. Both solutions yield the same answer.
