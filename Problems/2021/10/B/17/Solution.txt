==Solution==
By logical deduction, we consider the scores from lowest to highest:
$$\begin{align*}
\text{Oscar's score is 4.} &\implies \text{Oscar is given cards 1 and 3.} \\
&\implies \text{Aditi is given cards 2 and 5.} \\
&\implies \text{Ravon is given cards 4 and 7.} && (\bigstar) \\
&\implies \text{Tyrone is given cards 6 and 10.} \\
&\implies \text{Kim is given cards 8 and 9.}
\end{align*}$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\text{Ravon was given card 4.}}$

Certainly, if we read the answer choices sooner, then we can stop at $(\bigstar)$ and pick $\textbf{(C)}.$
