==Solution 1 (Observations and Patterns: Considers Only 5 Squares)==
In the diagram below, the red arrows indicate the progression of numbers. In the second row from the top, the greatest number and the least number are $D$ and $E,$ respectively. Note that the numbers in the yellow cells are consecutive odd perfect squares, as we can prove by induction.

By observations, we proceed as follows:
$$\begin{alignat*}{6}
A=15^2=225, \ B=13^2=169 
\quad &\implies \quad &C &= \hspace{1mm}&&A-14\hspace{1mm} &= 211& \\ 
\quad &\implies \quad &D &= &&C-1  &= 210& \\ 
\quad &\implies \quad &E &= &&B-12 &= 157&. 
\end{alignat*}$$
Therefore, the answer is $D+E=\boxed{\textbf{(A)} ~367}.$
