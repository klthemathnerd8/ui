==Solution 1==

We can set the point on $CD$ where the fold occurs as point $F$. Then, we can set $FD$ as $x$, and $CF$ as $1-x$ because of symmetry due to the fold. It can be recognized that this is a right triangle, and solving for $x$, we get, 

$$x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = (1-x)^2 \rightarrow x^2 + \frac{1}{9} = x^2 - 2x + 1 \rightarrow x=\frac{4}{9}$$

We know this is a 3-4-5 triangle because the side lengths are $\frac{3}{9}, \frac{4}{9}, \frac{5}{9}$. We also know that $EAC'$ is similar to $C'DF$ because angle $EC'F$ is a right angle. Now, we can use similarity to find out that the perimeter is just the perimeter of $C'DF \times \frac{AC'}{DF}$. That's just $\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = 2$. Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)} ~2}$
