In a plane, four circles with radii $1,3,5,$ and $7$ are tangent to line $\ell$ at the same point $A,$ but they may be on either side of $\ell$. Region $S$ consists of all the points that lie inside exactly one of the four circles. What is the maximum possible area of region $S$?

$\textbf{(A) }24\pi \qquad \textbf{(B) }32\pi \qquad \textbf{(C) }64\pi \qquad \textbf{(D) }65\pi \qquad \textbf{(E) }84\pi$
