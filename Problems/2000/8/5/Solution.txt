==Solution==

If the first year of the $8$-year period was the final year of a principal's
term, then in the next six years two more principals would serve, and the last year of the
period would be the first year of the fourth principal's term. Therefore, the maximum
number of principals who can serve during an $8$-year period is $4$, so the answer is $\boxed{C}$
if the terms are divided $1\ |\ 2\ 3\ 4\ |\ 5\ 6\ 7\ |\ 8$
