==Solution 1==

The side of the large square is $1 + 3 + 1 = 5$, so the area of the large square is $5^2 = 25$.

The area of the middle square is $3^2$, and the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares is $2 * 1^2 = 2$.

Thus, the big square minus the three smaller squares is $25 - 9 - 2 = 14$.  This is the area of the two congruent L-shaped regions.

So the area of one L-shaped region is $\frac{14}{2} = 7$, and the answer is $\boxed{A}$
