==Solution==

The only way to get a negative product using three numbers is to multiply one negative number and two positives or three negatives. Only two reasonable choices
exist: $(-8)\times(-6)\times(-4) = (-8)\times(24) = -192$ and $(-8)\times5\times7 = (-8)\times35 = -280$.
The latter is smaller, so $\boxed{\text{(B)\ -280}}$.
