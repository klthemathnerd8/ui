It is not hard to see that 
$$(A+1)(M+1)(C+1)=$$
$$AMC+AM+AC+MC+A+M+C+1$$
Since $A+M+C=12$, we can rewrite this as
$$(A+1)(M+1)(C+1)=$$
$$AMC+AM+AC+MC+13$$
So we wish to maximize
$$(A+1)(M+1)(C+1)-13$$
Which is largest when all the factors are equal (consequence of AM-GM).  Since $A+M+C=12$, we set $A=M=C=4$
Which gives us 
$$(4+1)(4+1)(4+1)-13=112$$
so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }112}.$
