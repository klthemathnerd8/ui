Since $6$ and $4$ are fixed sides, the smallest possible side has to be larger than $6-4=2$ and the largest possible side has to be smaller than $6+4=10$. This gives us the triangle inequality $2<x<10$ and $2<y<10$. $7$ can be attained by letting $x=9.1$ and $y=2.1$. However, $8=10-2$ cannot be attained. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\bold{D}}$.
