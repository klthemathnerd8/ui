== Problem ==
Through a point on the [[hypotenuse]] of a [[right triangle]], lines are drawn [[parallel]] to the legs of the triangle so that the triangle is divided into a [[square]] and two smaller right triangles. The area of one of the two small right triangles is $m$ times the area of the square. The [[ratio]] of the area of the other small right triangle to the area of the square is 

$\textbf {(A)}\ \frac{1}{2m+1} \qquad \textbf {(B)}\ m \qquad \textbf {(C)}\ 1-m \qquad \textbf {(D)}\ \frac{1}{4m} \qquad \textbf {(E)}\ \frac{1}{8m^2}$
