==Solution 1==

Any two prime numbers between 4 and 18 have an odd product and an even sum. Any odd number minus an even number is an odd number, so we can eliminate A, B, and D. Since the highest two prime numbers we can pick are 13 and 17, the highest number we can make is $(13)(17)-(13+17) = 221 - 30 = 191$. Thus, we can eliminate E. So, the answer must be $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }119}$.
