== Problem ==
One base of a [[trapezoid]] is <math>100</math> units longer than the other base. The segment that joins the [[midpoint]]s of the legs divides the trapezoid into two regions whose areas are in the ratio <math>2: 3</math>. Let <math>x</math> be the length of the segment joining the legs of the trapezoid that is [[parallel]] to the bases and that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. Find the [[ceiling function|greatest integer]] that does not exceed <math>x^2/100</math>.
