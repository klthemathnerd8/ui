== Solution ==
There are <math>\binom{8}{5}</math> ways to choose the rings, and there are <math>5!</math> distinct arrangements to order the rings [we order them so that the first ring is the bottom-most on the first finger that actually has a ring, and so forth]. The number of ways to distribute the rings among the fingers is equivalent the number of ways we can drop five balls into 4 urns, or similarly dropping five balls into four compartments split by three dividers. The number of ways to arrange those dividers and balls is just <math>\binom {8}{3}</math>.

Multiplying gives the answer: <math>\binom{8}{5}\binom{8}{3}5! = 376320</math>, and the three leftmost digits are <math>\boxed{376}</math>.
