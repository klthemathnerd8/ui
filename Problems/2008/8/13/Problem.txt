==Problem==
Mr. Harman needs to know the combined weight in pounds of three boxes he wants to mail. However, the only available scale is not accurate for weights less than $100$ pounds or more than $150$ pounds. So the boxes are weighed in pairs in every possible way. The results are $122$, $125$ and $127$ pounds. What is the combined weight in pounds of the three boxes?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 160\qquad
\textbf{(B)}\ 170\qquad
\textbf{(C)}\ 187\qquad
\textbf{(D)}\ 195\qquad
\textbf{(E)}\ 354$
