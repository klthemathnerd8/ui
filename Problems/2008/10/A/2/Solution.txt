==Solution 1==
Since they are asking for the "ratio" of two things, we can say that the side of the square is anything that we want. So if we say that it is $1$, then the width of the rectangle is $2$, and the length is $4$, thus making the total area of the rectangle $8$. The area of the square is just $1$. So the percent of the rectangle's area inside the square is $\frac{1}{8} \times 100 = 12.5 \longrightarrow \fbox{A}$
