==Solution 1==
Set the time Ian traveled as $I$, and set Han's speed as $H$. Therefore, Jan's speed is $H+5.$

We get the following equation for how much Han is ahead of Ian:
$H+5I = 70.$

The expression for how much Jan is ahead of Ian is:
$2(H+5)+10I.$

This simplifies to: $2H+10+10I.$

However, this is just $2(H+5I)+10.$

Substitute, from the first equation, $H+5I$ as $70.$

Therefore, the answer is $140 + 10$, which is $150$, or $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}}$
