The machine completes one-third of the job in $\text{11:10}-\text{8:30}=\text{2:40}$ hours. Thus, the entire job is completed in $3\cdot(\text{2:40})=\text{8:00}$ hours.

Since the machine was started at $\text{8:30 AM}$, the job will be finished $8$ hours later, at $\text{4:30 PM}$. The answer is $\mathrm{(D)}$.

Note: $\text{2:40}$ means $2$ hours and $40$ minutes. $3$ multiplied by this time interval is $8$ hours.
