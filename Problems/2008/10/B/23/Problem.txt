==Problem==
A rectangular floor measures $a$ by $b$ feet, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b > a$. An artist paints a rectangle on the floor with the sides of the rectangle parallel to the floor. The unpainted part of the floor forms a border of width $1$ foot around the painted rectangle and occupies half the area of the whole floor. How many possibilities are there for the ordered pair $(a,b)$?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 3\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 4\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 5$
