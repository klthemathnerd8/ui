By the Pythagorean theorem, $a^2+b^2=b^2+2b+1$

This means that $a^2=2b+1$.

We know that $a,b>0$ and that $b<100$.

We also know that $a^2$ is odd and thus $a$ is odd, since the right side of the equation is odd. $2b$ is even. $2b+1$ is odd.

So $a=1,3,5,7,9,11,13$, but if $a=1$, then $b=0$. Thus $a\neq1.$

$a=3,5,7,9,11,13$

The answer is $\boxed{A}$.
