==Solution 1==
If the basketball player makes $x$ three-point shots and $5-x$ two-point shots, he scores $3x+2(5-x)=10+x$ points. Clearly every value of $x$ yields a different number of total points. Since he can make any number of three-point shots between $0$ and $5$ inclusive, the number of different point totals is $6 \Rightarrow E$.
===Solution 2===
Stars and bars can also be utilized to solve this problem. Since we need to decide what number of 2's and 3's are scored, and there are a total of 5 shots. It can be written like such: _ _ _ | _ _. Solving this, we get $6 \Rightarrow E$.
