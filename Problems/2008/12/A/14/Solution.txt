Area is invariant under translation, so after translating left $6$ and up $7/2$ units, we have the inequality

$$|3x| + |2y|\leq 3$$

which forms a [[rhombus|diamond]] centered at the [[origin]] and vertices at $(\pm 1, 0), (0, \pm 1.5)$. Thus the diagonals are of length $2$ and $3$. Using the formula $A = \frac 12 d_1 d_2$, the answer is $\frac{1}{2}(2)(3) = 3 \Rightarrow \mathrm{(A)}$.
