=== Solution 1 ===
Doug can paint $\frac{1}{5}$ of a room per hour, Dave can paint $\frac{1}{7}$ of a room per hour, and the time they spend working together is $t-1$.

Since rate multiplied by time gives output, $\left(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{7}\right)\left(t-1\right)=1 \Rightarrow \mathrm{(D)}$

=== Solution 2 ===

If one person does a job in $a$ hours and another person does a job in $b$ hours, the time it takes to do the job together is $\frac{ab}{a+b}$ hours.

Since Doug paints a room in 5 hours and Dave paints a room in 7 hours, they both paint in $\frac{5\times7}{5+7} = \frac{35}{12}$ hours. They also take 1 hour for lunch, so the total time $t = \frac{35}{12} + 1$ hours.

Looking at the answer choices, $(D)$ is the only one satisfied by $t = \frac{35}{12} + 1$.
