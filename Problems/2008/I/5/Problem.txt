== Problem ==
A right circular [[cone]] has base radius <math>r</math> and height <math>h</math>.  The cone lies on its side on a flat table.  As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered  at the point where the vertex touches the table.  The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making <math>17</math> complete rotations.  The value of <math>h/r</math> can be written in the form <math>m\sqrt {n}</math>, where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are positive integers and <math>n</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find <math>m + n</math>.
