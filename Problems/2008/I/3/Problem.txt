== Problem ==
Ed and Sue bike at equal and constant rates.  Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates.  Ed covers <math>74</math> kilometers after biking for <math>2</math> hours, jogging for <math>3</math> hours, and swimming for <math>4</math> hours, while Sue covers <math>91</math> kilometers after jogging for <math>2</math> hours, swimming for <math>3</math> hours, and biking for <math>4</math> hours.  Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour.  Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.
