== Solution ==
Let the lengths of the three sides of the rectangular solid after the cutting be <math>a,b,c</math>, so that the desired volume is <math>abc</math>. Note that each cut reduces one of the dimensions by one, so that after ten cuts, <math>a+b+c = 10 + 13 + 14 - 10 = 27</math>. By [[AM-GM]], <math>\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 9 \ge \sqrt[3]{abc} \Longrightarrow abc \le \boxed{729}</math>. Equality is achieved when <math>a=b=c=9</math>, which is possible if we make one slice perpendicular to the <math>10</math> cm edge, four slices perpendicular to the <math>13</math> cm edge, and five slices perpendicular to the <math>14</math> cm edge.
