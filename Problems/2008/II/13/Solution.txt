== Solution 1==
If you're familiar with inversion, you'll see that the problem's basically asking you to invert the hexagon with respect to the unit circle in the Cartesian Plane using the Inversion Distance Formula. This works because the point in the Cartesian Plane's complex plane equivalent switches places with its conjugate but we can do that in the Cartesian plane too (just reflect a point in the Cartesian plane over the x-axis)! If you're familiar with inversion you can go plot the inverted figure's Cartesian Plane Equivalent. Then simply continue on with the figure shown in the below solution.
