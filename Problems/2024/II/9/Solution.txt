==Solution 1==
The problem says "some", so not all cells must be occupied.
We start by doing casework on the column on the left. There can be 5,4,3,2, or 1 black chip. The same goes for white chips, so we will multiply by 2 at the end. There is <math>1</math> way to select <math>5</math> cells with black chips. Because of the 2nd condition, there can be no white, and the grid must be all black- <math>1</math> way . There are <math>5</math> ways to select 4 cells with black chips. We now consider the row that does not contain a black chip. The first cell must be blank, and the remaining <math>4</math> cells have <math>2^4-1</math> different ways(<math>-1</math> comes from all blank). This gives us <math>75</math> ways. Notice that for 3,2 or 1 black chips on the left there is a pattern. Once the first blank row is chosen, the rest of the blank rows must be ordered similarly. For example, with 2 black chips on the left, there will be 3 blank rows. There are 15 ways for the first row to be chosen, and the following 2 rows must have the same order. Thus, The number of ways for 3,2,and 1 black chips is <math>10*15</math>, <math>10*15</math>, <math>5*15</math>. Adding these up, we have <math>1+75+150+150+75 = 451</math>. Multiplying this by 2, we get <math>\boxed{902}</math>.
