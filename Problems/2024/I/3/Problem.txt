==Problem==

Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of <math>n</math> tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either <math>1</math> token or <math>4</math> tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers <math>n</math> less than or equal to <math>2024</math> for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.
