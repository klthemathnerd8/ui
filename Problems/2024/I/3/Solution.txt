==Solution 1==
Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are <math>3</math>, Alice will take <math>1</math>, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are <math>4</math>, Alice will just remove all <math>4</math> at once. If there are <math>5</math>, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are <math>1</math>, <math>3</math>, or <math>4</math> coins left. Bob wins if there are <math>2</math> or <math>5</math> coins left.

After some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is n is a multiple of <math>5</math>, then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of <math>5</math> coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes <math>1</math>, Bob will take <math>4</math>, and there will still be a multiple of <math>5</math>. If Alice takes <math>4</math>, Bob will take <math>1</math>, and there will still be a multiple of <math>5</math>. This process will continue until you get <math>0</math> coins left. For example, let's say there are <math>205</math> coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of <math>5</math> left. This will continue until there are <math>5</math> coins left, and Bob will end up winning.

After some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to <math>2</math> mod <math>5</math> will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are <math>2</math> coins left, Alice is forced to take <math>1</math> and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are <math>72</math> coins. If Alice takes <math>1</math>, Bob will take <math>4</math>. If Alice takes <math>4</math>, Bob will take <math>1</math>. So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to <math>2</math> mod <math>5</math>. Eventually, there will be only <math>2</math> coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take <math>1</math> and Bob will take the final coin.

So we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to <math>2024</math> that are either congruent to <math>0</math> mod <math>5</math> or <math>2</math> mod <math>5</math>. There are <math>404</math> numbers in the first category: <math>5, 10, 15, \dots, 2020</math>. For the second category, there are <math>405</math> numbers. <math>2, 7, 12, 17, \dots, 2022</math>. So the answer is <math>404 + 405 = \boxed{809}</math>
