==Solution 1==
Draw an altitude from both end circles of the diagram with the circles of radius one, and call the lengths you get drawing the altitudes of the circles down to <math>BC</math> <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>. Now we have the length of side <math>BC</math> of being <math>(2)(2022)+1+1+a+b</math>. However, the side <math>BC</math> can also be written as <math>(6)(68)+34+34+34a+34b</math>, due to similar triangles from the second diagram. If we set the equations equal, we have <math>\frac{1190}{11} = a+b</math>. Call the radius of the incircle <math>r</math>, then we have the side BC to be <math>r(a+b)</math>. We find <math>r</math> as <math>\frac{4046+\frac{1190}{11}}{\frac{1190}{11}}</math>, which simplifies to <math>\frac{10+((34)(11))}{10}</math>,so we have <math>\frac{192}{5}</math>, which sums to <math>\boxed{197}</math>.
