Every morning Aya goes for a <math>9</math>-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of <math>s</math> kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including <math>t</math> minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks <math>s+2</math> kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including <math>t</math> minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at <math>s+\frac{1}{2}</math> kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the <math>t</math> minutes spent in the coffee shop.
