==Solution 1==

First, figure out all pairs of numbers whose product is 6. Then, using the process of elimination, we can find the following: 

$\textbf{(A)}$ is possible: $2\times 3$ 

$\textbf{(C)}$ is possible: $1\times 6$ 

$\textbf{(D)}$ is possible: $2\times 6$ 

$\textbf{(E)}$ is possible: $3\times 6$

The only integer that cannot be the sum is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)\ 6}}.$
