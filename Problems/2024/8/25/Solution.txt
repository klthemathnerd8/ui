==Solution 1 (Complementary Counting Casework)==

Suppose the passengers are indistinguishable. There are $\binom{12}{8} = 495$ total ways to distribute the passengers. We proceed with complementary counting, and instead, will count the number of passenger arrangements such that the couple cannot sit anywhere. Consider the partitions of $8$ among the rows of $3$ seats, to make our lives easier, assume they are non-increasing. We have $(3, 3, 2, 0), (3, 3, 1, 1), (3, 2, 2, 1), (2, 2, 2, 2)$. 


For the first partition, clearly the couple will always be able to sit in the row with $0$ occupied seats, so we have $0$ cases here.


For the second partition, there are $\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$ ways to permute the partition. Now the rows with exactly $1$ passenger must be in the middle, so this case generates $6$ cases.


For the third partition, there are $\frac{4!}{2!} = 12$ ways to permute the partition. For rows with $2$ passengers, there are $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to arrange them in the row so that the couple cannot sit there. The row with $1$ passenger must be in the middle. We obtain $12 \cdot 3^2 = 108$ cases.


For the fourth partition, there is $1$ way to permute the partition. As said before, rows with $2$ passengers can be arranged in $3$ ways, so we obtain $3^4 = 81$ cases.


Collectively, we obtain a grand total of $6 + 108 + 81 = 195$ cases. The final probability is $1 - \frac{195}{495} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}~\frac{20}{33}}$.
