==Solution 1==
Let $x$ denote the number of guppies in the first tank.

Then, we have the following for the number of guppies in the rest of the tanks:

*$x + 1 =$ the number of guppies in the second tank
*$x + 1 + 2 =$ the number of guppies in the third tank
*$x + 1 + 2 + 3 =$ the number of guppies in the fourth tank

The number of guppies in all of the tanks combined is 90, so we can write the equation

$x + x + 1 + x + 1 + 2 + x + 1 + 2 + 3 = 90$.

Simplifying the equation gives

$4x + 10 = 90$.

Solving the resulting equation gives $x = 20$, so the number of guppies in the fourth tank is $20 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 26$.

Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 26}$.
