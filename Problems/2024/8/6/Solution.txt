==Solution 1==

You can measure the lengths of the paths until you find a couple of guaranteed true inferred statements as such:
Q is greater than S, 
P is greater than R, 
and R and P are the smallest two, therefore the order is R, P, S, Q.
Thus we get the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}~R, P, S, Q}$.
