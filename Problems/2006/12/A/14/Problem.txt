== Problem ==

Two farmers agree that pigs are worth $300$ dollars and that goats are worth $210$ dollars. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with "change" received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $390$ dollar debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?

$ \textbf{(A) } 5\qquad \textbf{(B) } 10\qquad \textbf{(C) } 30\qquad \textbf{(D) } 90\qquad \textbf{(E) }  210$
