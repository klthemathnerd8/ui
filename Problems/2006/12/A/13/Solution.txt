== Solution ==
Let the radius of the smallest circle be $r_A$, the radius of the second largest circle be $r_B$, and the radius of the largest circle be $r_C$. 
$$r_A + r_B = 3$$
$$r_A + r_C = 4$$
$$r_ B + r_C = 5$$

Adding up all these equations and then dividing both sides by 2, we get,

$$r_A + r_B + r_C = 6$$

Then, we get $r_A = 1$, $r_B = 2$, and $r_C = 3$ Then we get $1^2 \pi + 2^2 \pi + 3^2 \pi = 14 \pi \iff\mathrm{(E)}$
