To find the area of the regular hexagon, we only need to calculate the side length.
a distance of $\sqrt{7^2+1^2} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$ apart.  Half of this distance is the length of the longer leg of the right triangles.  Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is $\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\cdot2 = \frac{5\sqrt{6}}{3}$.

The apothem is thus $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{5\sqrt{6}}{3}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}$, yielding an area of $\frac{1}{2}\cdot10\sqrt{6}\cdot\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}=25\sqrt{3} \implies \mathrm{(C)}$.
