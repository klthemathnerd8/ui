== Solution 1 ==

Let the starting point be $(0,0)$. After $10$ steps we can only be in locations $(x,y)$ where $|x|+|y|\leq 10$. Additionally, each step changes the [[parity]] of exactly one coordinate. Hence after $10$ steps we can only be in locations $(x,y)$ where $x+y$ is even. It can easily be shown that each location that satisfies these two conditions is indeed reachable.

Once we pick $x\in\{-10,\dots,10\}$, we have $11-|x|$ valid choices for $y$, giving a total of $\boxed{121}$ possible positions.
