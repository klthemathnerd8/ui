===Solution 1===
If the Cougars won by a margin of 14 points, then the Panthers' score would be half of (34-14). That's 10 $\Rightarrow \boxed{\text{(A)}}$.

===Solution 2===
Let the Panthers' score be $x$. The Cougars then scored $x+14$. Since the teams combined scored $34$, we get $x+x+14=34 \\ \rightarrow 2x+14=34 \\ \rightarrow 2x=20 \\ \rightarrow x = 10$, 

and the answer is  $\boxed{\text{(A)}}$.
