==Solution 1 (Alcumus Edition)==
Let the integer have digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, read left to right. Because $1 \leq a<b<c$, none of the digits can be zero and $c$ cannot be 2. If $c=4$, then $a$ and $b$ must each be chosen from the digits 1, 2, and 3. Therefore there are $\binom{3}{2}=3$ choices for $a$ and $b$, and for each choice there is one acceptable order. Similarly, for $c=6$ and $c=8$ there are, respectively, $\binom{5}{2}=10$ and $\binom{7}{2}=21$ choices for $a$ and $b$. Thus there are altogether $3+10+21=\boxed{34}$ such integers.
