The power of $10$ for any factorial is given by the well-known algorithm 
$$\left\lfloor \frac
n{5}\right\rfloor +
\left\lfloor \frac n{25}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac n{125}\right\rfloor + \cdots$$
It is rational to guess numbers right before powers of $5$ because we won't have any extra numbers from higher powers of $5$. As we list out the powers of 5, it is clear that $5^{4}=625$ is less than 2006 and  $5^{5}=3125$ is greater. Therefore, set $a$ and $b$ to be 624. Thus, c is $2006-(624\cdot 2)=758$. Applying the algorithm, we see that our answer is $152+152+188= \boxed{492}$.
