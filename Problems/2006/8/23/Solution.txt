===Solution 1===
The counting numbers that leave a remainder of $4$ when divided by $6$ are
$4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \cdots$ The counting numbers that leave a remainder of $3$ when
divided by $5$ are $3,8,13,18,23,28,33, \cdots$ So $28$ is the smallest possible number
of coins that meets both conditions. Because 28 is divisible by 7, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0}$ coins left
when they are divided among seven people.

===Solution 2===

If there were two more coins in the box, the number of coins would be divisible
by both $6$ and $5$. The smallest number that is divisible by $6$ and $5$ is $30$, so the
smallest possible number of coins in the box is $28$ and the remainder when divided by $7$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0}$.
