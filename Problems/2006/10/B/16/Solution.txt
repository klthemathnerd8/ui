== Solution ==
There are $365$ days in a year, plus $1$ extra day if there is a Leap Day, which occurs on years that are multiples of $4$ (with a few exceptions that don't affect this problem). 

Therefore, the number of days between Leap Day $2004$ and Leap Day $2020$ is: 

$ 16 \cdot 365 + 4 \cdot 1 = 5844 $

Since the days of the week repeat every $7$ days and $ 5844 \equiv -1 \bmod{7}$, the day of the week Leap Day $2020$ occurs is the day of the week the day before Leap Day $2004$ occurs, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\textrm{Saturday}}$.
