== Solution ==
After drinking and adding cream, Joe's cup has $2$ ounces of cream. 

After adding cream to her cup, JoAnn's cup had $14$ ounces of liquid. By stirring and then drinking $2$ ounces out of the $14$ ounces of liquid, she drank 
$\frac{2}{14}=\frac{1}{7}$th of the cream. So there are $2\cdot\frac{6}{7}=\frac{12}{7}$ ounces of cream left. 

So the desired ratio is: $2 \div \frac{12}{7}= \boxed{\textbf{(E) }\frac{7}{6}}$.
