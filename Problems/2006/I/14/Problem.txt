== Problem ==
A tripod has three legs each of length <math>5</math> feet. When the tripod is set up, the [[angle]] between any pair of legs is equal to the angle between any other pair, and the top of the tripod is <math>4</math> feet from the ground. In setting up the tripod, the lower 1 foot of one leg breaks off. Let <math> h </math> be the height in feet of the top of the tripod from the ground when the broken tripod is set up. Then <math> h </math> can be written in the form <math> \frac m{\sqrt{n}}, </math> where <math> m </math> and <math> n </math> are positive integers and <math> n </math> is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find <math> \lfloor m+\sqrt{n}\rfloor. </math> (The notation <math> \lfloor x\rfloor </math> denotes the greatest integer that is less than or equal to <math> x. </math>)
