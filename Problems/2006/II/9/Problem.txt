== Problem ==
[[Circle]]s <math> \mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2, </math> and <math> \mathcal{C}_3 </math> have their [[center]]s at (0,0), (12,0), and (24,0), and have [[radius|radii]] 1, 2, and 4, respectively. Line <math> t_1 </math> is a common internal [[tangent]] to <math>\mathcal{C}_1</math> and <math>\mathcal{C}_2</math> and has a positive [[slope]], and line <math>t_2</math> is a common internal tangent to <math>\mathcal{C}_2</math> and <math>\mathcal{C}_3</math> and has a negative slope. Given that lines <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math> intersect at <math>(x,y),</math> and that <math>x=p-q\sqrt{r},</math> where <math>p, q,</math> and <math>r</math> are positive integers and <math>r</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime, find <math>p+q+r.</math>
