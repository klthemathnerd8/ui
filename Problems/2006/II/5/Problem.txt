== Problem ==
When rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face <math> F </math> is greater than <math>1/6</math>, the probability of obtaining the face opposite is less than <math>1/6</math>, the probability of obtaining any one of the other four faces is <math>1/6</math>, and the sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is <math>47/288</math>. Given that the [[probability]] of obtaining face <math> F </math>  is <math> m/n, </math> where <math> m </math> and <math> n </math> are [[relatively prime]] positive integers, find <math> m+n. </math>
