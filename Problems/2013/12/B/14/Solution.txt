==Solution 1==
Let the first two terms of the first sequence be $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ and the first two of the second sequence be $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$.  Computing the seventh term, we see that $5x_{1} + 8x_{2} = 5y_{1} + 8y_{2}$.  Note that this means that $x_{1}$ and $y_{1}$ must have the same value modulo $8$.  To minimize, let one of them be $0$; [[WLOG]], assume that $x_{1} = 0$.  Thus, the smallest possible value of $y_{1}$ is $8$; and since the sequences are non-decreasing we get $y_{2} \ge 8$.  To minimize, let $y_{2} = 8$.  Thus, $5y_{1} + 8y_{2} = 40 + 64 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }104}$.
