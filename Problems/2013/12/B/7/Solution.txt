We notice that the number of numbers said is incremented by one each time; that is, Jo says one number, then Blair says two numbers, then Jo says three numbers, etc.  Thus, after nine "turns", $1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45$ numbers have been said.  In the tenth turn, the eighth number will be the 53rd number said, because $53-45=8$.  Since we are starting from 1 every turn, the 53rd number said will be $\boxed{\textbf{(E) }8}$.
