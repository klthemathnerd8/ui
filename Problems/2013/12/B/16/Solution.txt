==Solution 1==

The five pointed star can be thought of as five triangles sitting on the five sides of the pentagon. Because the pentagon is equiangular, each of its angles has measure $\frac{180^\circ (5-2)}{5}=108^\circ$, and so the base angles of the aforementioned triangles (i.e., the angles adjacent to the pentagon) have measure $180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ$. The base angles are equal, so the triangles must be isosceles.

Let one of the sides of the pentagon have length $x_1$ (and the others $x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$). Then, by trigonometry, the non-base sides of the triangle sitting on that side of the pentagon each has length $\frac{x_1}{2} \sec 72^\circ$, and so the two sides together have length $x_1 \sec 72^\circ$. To find the perimeter of the star, we sum up the lengths of the non-base sides for each of the five triangles to get $(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5) \sec 72^\circ = (1) \sec 72^\circ = \sec 72^\circ$ (because the perimeter of the pentagon is $1$). The perimeter of the star is constant, so the difference between the maximum and minimum perimeters is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)} \ 0}$.
