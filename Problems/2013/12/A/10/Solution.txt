==Solution 1==
Note that $\frac{1}{11} = 0.\overline{09}$.

Dividing by 3 gives $\frac{1}{33} = 0.\overline{03}$, and dividing by 9 gives $\frac{1}{99} = 0.\overline{01}$.

$S = \{11, 33, 99\}$

$11 + 33 + 99 = 143$

The answer must be at least $143$, but cannot be $155$ since no $n \le 12$ other than $11$ satisfies the conditions, so the answer is $143$.
