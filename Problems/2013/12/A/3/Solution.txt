We are given that $\frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$ of the flowers are pink, so we know $\frac{2}{5}$ of the flowers are red.

Since $\frac{1}{3}$ of the pink flowers are roses, $\frac{2}{3}$ of the pink flowers are carnations.

We are given that $\frac{3}{4}$ of the red flowers are carnations.

The percent of flowers that are carnations is 

$\frac{3}{5} * \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{5} * \frac{3}{4} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{10} = \frac{7}{10} = 70\%$, which is $E$
