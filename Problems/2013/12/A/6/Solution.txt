Let the number of 3-point shots attempted be $x$. Since she attempted 30 shots, the number of 2-point shots attempted must be $30 - x$.

Since she was successful on $20\%$, or $\frac{1}{5}$, of her 3-pointers, and $30\%$, or $\frac{3}{10}$, of her 2-pointers, then her score must be

$\frac{1}{5}*3x + \frac{3}{10}*2(30-x)$


$\frac{3}{5}*x + \frac{3}{5}(30-x)$


$\frac{3}{5}(x+30-x)$


$\frac{3}{5}*30$


$18$, which is $B$
