==Solution 1==

There are $10 \cdot 12 = 120$ cubes on the base of the box. Then, for each of the 4 layers above the bottom (as since each cube is 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 foot and the box is 5 feet tall, there are 4 feet left), there are $9 + 11 + 9 + 11 = 40$ cubes. Hence, the answer is $120 + 4 \cdot 40 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 280}$.
