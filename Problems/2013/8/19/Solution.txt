If Hannah did better than Cassie, there would be no way she could know for sure that she didn't get the lowest score in the class. Therefore, Hannah did worse than Cassie. Similarly, if Hannah did worse than Bridget, there is no way Bridget could have known that she didn't get the highest in the class. Therefore, Hannah did better than Bridget, so our order is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) Cassie, Hannah, Bridget}}$



Note: It could be said that Cassie did better than Hannah, and Bridget knew this, and she had the same score as Hannah, so Bridget didn't get the highest score. This may be a reason that MAA didn't put this answer choice in.
