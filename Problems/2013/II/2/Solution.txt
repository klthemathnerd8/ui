==Solution 1==
To simplify, we write this logarithmic expression as an exponential one. Just looking at  the first log, it has a base of 2 and an argument of the expression in parenthesis. Therefore, we can make 2 the base, 0 the exponent, and the argument the result. That means <math>\log_{2^a}(\log_{2^b}(2^{1000}))=1</math> (because <math>2^0=1</math>). Doing this again, we get <math>\log_{2^b}(2^{1000})=2^a</math>. Doing the process one more time, we finally eliminate all of the logs, getting <math>{(2^{b})}^{(2^a)}=2^{1000}</math>. Using the property that <math>{(a^x)^{y}}=a^{xy}</math>, we simplify to <math>2^{b\cdot2^{a}}=2^{1000}</math>. Eliminating equal bases leaves <math>b\cdot2^a=1000</math>. The largest <math>a</math> such that <math>2^a</math> divides <math>1000</math> is <math>3</math>, so we only need to check <math>1</math>,<math>2</math>, and <math>3</math>. When <math>a=1</math>, <math>b=500</math>; when <math>a=2</math>, <math>b=250</math>; when <math>a=3</math>, <math>b=125</math>. Summing all the <math>a</math>'s and <math>b</math>'s gives the answer of <math>\boxed{881}</math>.

Note that <math>a</math> cannot be <math>0,</math> since that would cause the <math>\log_{2^a}</math> to have a <math>1</math> in the base, which is not possible (also the problem specifies that <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are positive).
