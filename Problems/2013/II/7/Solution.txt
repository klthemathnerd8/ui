There are <math>x</math> clerks at the beginning, and <math>t</math> clerks are reassigned to another task at the end of each hour. So, <math>30x+30(x-t)+30(x-2t)+30\cdot\frac{10}{60} \cdot (x-3t)=1775</math>, and simplify that we get <math>19x-21t=355</math>.
Now the problem is to find a reasonable integer solution. Now we know <math>x= \frac{355+21t}{19}</math>, so <math>19</math> divides <math>355+21t</math>, AND as long as <math>t</math> is a integer, <math>19</math> must divide <math>2t+355</math>. Now, we suppose that <math>19m=2t+355</math>, similarly we get <math>t=\frac{19m-355}{2}</math>, and so in order to get a minimum integer solution for <math>t</math>, it is obvious that <math>m=19</math> works. So we get <math>t=3</math> and <math>x=22</math>.  One and a half hour's work should be <math>30x+15(x-t)</math>, so the answer is <math>\boxed{945}</math>.
