==Problem 3==
A large candle is <math>119</math> centimeters tall.  It is designed to burn down more quickly when it is first lit and more slowly as it approaches its bottom.  Specifically, the candle takes <math>10</math> seconds to burn down the first centimeter from the top, <math>20</math> seconds to burn down the second centimeter, and <math>10k</math> seconds to burn down the <math>k</math>-th centimeter.  Suppose it takes <math>T</math> seconds for the candle to burn down completely.  Then <math>\tfrac{T}{2}</math> seconds after it is lit, the candle's height in centimeters will be <math>h</math>.  Find <math>10h</math>.
