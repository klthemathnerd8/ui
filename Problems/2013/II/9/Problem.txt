==Problem 9==
A <math>7\times 1</math> board is completely covered by <math>m\times 1</math> tiles without overlap; each tile may cover any number of consecutive squares, and each tile lies completely on the board. Each tile is either red, blue, or green. Let <math>N</math> be the number of tilings of the <math>7\times 1</math> board in which all three colors are used at least once. For example, a <math>1\times 1</math> red tile followed by a <math>2\times 1</math> green tile, a <math>1\times 1</math> green tile, a <math>2\times 1</math> blue tile, and a <math>1\times 1</math> green tile is a valid tiling. Note that if the <math>2\times 1</math> blue tile is replaced by two <math>1\times 1</math> blue tiles, this results in a different tiling. Find the remainder when <math>N</math> is divided by <math>1000</math>.
