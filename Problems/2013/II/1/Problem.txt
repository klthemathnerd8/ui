==Problem 1==
Suppose that the measurement of time during the day is converted to the metric system so that each day has <math>10</math> metric hours, and each metric hour has <math>100</math> metric minutes. Digital clocks would then be produced that would read <math>\text{9:99}</math> just before midnight, <math>\text{0:00}</math> at midnight, <math>\text{1:25}</math> at the former <math>\text{3:00}</math> AM, and <math>\text{7:50}</math> at the former <math>\text{6:00}</math> PM. After the conversion, a person who wanted to wake up at the equivalent of the former <math>\text{6:36}</math> AM would set his new digital alarm clock for <math>\text{A:BC}</math>, where <math>\text{A}</math>, <math>\text{B}</math>, and <math>\text{C}</math> are digits. Find <math>100\text{A}+10\text{B}+\text{C}</math>.
