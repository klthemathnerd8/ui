$x\clubsuit y = x^2y-xy^2 $ and $y\clubsuit x = y^2x-yx^2$. Therefore, we have the equation $ x^2y-xy^2 = y^2x-yx^2$ Factoring out a $-1$ gives $ x^2y-xy^2 = -(x^2y-xy^2)$ Factoring both sides further, $xy(x-y) = -xy(x-y)$. It follows that if $x=0$, $y=0$, or $(x-y)=0$, both sides of the equation equal 0. By this, there are 3 lines ($x=0$, $y=0$, or $x=y$) so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\text{ three lines}}$.
