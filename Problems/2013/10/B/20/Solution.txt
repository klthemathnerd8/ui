The prime factorization of $ 2013 $ is $ 61\cdot11\cdot3 $. To have a factor of $61$ in the numerator and to minimize $a_1,$ $a_1$ must equal $61$. Now we notice that there can be no prime $p$ which is not a factor of $2013$ such that $ b_1<p<61,$ because this prime will not be canceled out in the denominator, and will lead to an extra factor in the numerator. The highest prime less than $61$ is $59$, so there must be a factor of $59$ in the denominator. It follows that $b_1 = 59$ (to minimize $b_1$ as well), so the answer is $|61-59| = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }2}$. One possible way to express $ 2013 $ with $(a_1, b_1) = (61, 59)$ is  $$ 2013 = \frac{61!\cdot19!\cdot11!}{59!\cdot20!\cdot10!}. $$
