==Solution 1==

Because the $5$-year-old stayed home, we know that the $11$-year-old did not go to the movies, as the $5$-year-old did not and $11+5=16$.  Also, the $11$-year-old could not have gone to play baseball, as he is older than $10$.  Thus, the $11$-year-old must have stayed home, so Joey is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }11}$
