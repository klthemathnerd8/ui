To get how many cups we need, we realize that we simply need to divide the number of cups needed by the number of cups collected in her measuring cup each time.  Thus, we need to evaluate the fraction $\frac{2\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}}$.  Simplifying, this is equal to $\frac{5}{2}(4) = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }10}$
