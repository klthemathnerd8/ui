==Solution 1 (Process of Elimination)==

The shortest side length has the longest altitude perpendicular to it. The average of the two altitudes given will be between the lengths of the two altitudes,
therefore the length of the side perpendicular to that altitude will be between $10$ and $15$. The only answer choice that meets this requirement is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }12}$.
