==Solution==
We want the integers $b$ such that $ 2013\equiv 3\pmod{b} \Rightarrow b $ is a factor of $2010$. Since $2010=2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 67$, it has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=16$ factors. Since $b$ cannot equal $1, 2, $ or $3$, as these cannot have the digit $3$ in their base representations, our answer is $16-3=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}$
