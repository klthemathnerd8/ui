==Solution 1==
Let's work backwards. The minimum base-sixteen representation of <math>g(n)</math> that cannot be expressed using only the digits <math>0</math> through <math>9</math> is <math>A_{16}</math>, which is equal to <math>10</math> in base 10.  Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-eight representation of the sum of the digits of <math>f(n)</math> is <math>10</math>.  The minimum value for which this is achieved is <math>37_8</math>.  We have that <math>37_8 = 31</math>.  Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-four representation of <math>n</math> is <math>31</math>.  The minimum value for which this is achieved is <math>13,333,333,333_4</math>.  We just need this value in base 10 modulo 1000.  We get <math>13,333,333,333_4 = 3(1 + 4 + 4^2 + \dots + 4^8 + 4^9) + 4^{10} = 3\left(\dfrac{4^{10} - 1}{3}\right) + 4^{10} = 2*4^{10} - 1</math>.  Taking this value modulo <math>1000</math>, we get the final answer of <math>\boxed{151}</math>.  (If you are having trouble with this step, note that <math>2^{10} = 1024 \equiv 24 \pmod{1000}</math>) ~ TopNotchMath
