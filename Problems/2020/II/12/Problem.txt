Let <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> be odd integers greater than <math>1.</math> An <math>m\times n</math> rectangle is made up of unit squares where the squares in the top row are numbered left to right with the integers <math>1</math> through <math>n</math>, those in the second row are numbered left to right with the integers <math>n + 1</math> through <math>2n</math>, and so on. Square <math>200</math> is in the top row, and square <math>2000</math> is in the bottom row. Find the number of ordered pairs <math>(m,n)</math> of odd integers greater than <math>1</math> with the property that, in the <math>m\times n</math> rectangle, the line through the centers of squares <math>200</math> and <math>2000</math> intersects the interior of square <math>1099</math>.
