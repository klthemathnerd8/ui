The areas bounded by the unit square and alternately bounded by the lines through <math>\left(\frac{5}{8},\frac{3}{8}\right)</math> that are vertical or have a slope of <math>1/2</math> show where <math>P</math> can be placed to satisfy the condition. One of the areas is a trapezoid with bases <math>1/16</math> and <math>3/8</math> and height <math>5/8</math>. The other area is a trapezoid with bases <math>7/16</math> and <math>5/8</math> and height <math>3/8</math>. Then, <cmath>\frac{\frac{1}{16}+\frac{3}{8}}{2}\cdot\frac{5}{8}+\frac{\frac{7}{16}+\frac{5}{8}}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{8}=\frac{86}{256}=\frac{43}{128}\implies43+128=\boxed{171}</cmath>
