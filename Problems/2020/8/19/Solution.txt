==Solution 1==
A number is divisible by $15$ precisely if it is divisible by $3$ and $5$. The latter means the last digit must be either $5$ or $0$, and the former means the sum of the digits must be divisible by $3$. If the last digit is $0$, the first digit would be $0$ (because the digits alternate), which is not possible. Hence the last digit must be $5$, and the number is of the form $5\square 5\square 5$. If the unknown digit is $x$, we deduce $5+x+5+x+5 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \Rightarrow 2x \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$. We know $2^{-1}$ exists modulo $3$ because 2 is relatively prime to 3, so we conclude that $x$ (i.e. the second and fourth digit of the number) must be a multiple of $3$. It can be $0$, $3$, $6$, or $9$, so there are $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }4}$ options: $50505$, $53535$, $56565$, and $59595$.
