==Solution 1==
We will show that $22$, $11$, $22$, $44$, and $22$ meters are the heights of the trees from left to right. We are given that all tree heights are integers, so since Tree 2 has height $11$ meters, we can deduce that Trees 1 and 3 both have a height of $22$ meters. There are now three possible cases for the heights of Trees 4 and 5 (in order for them to be integers), namely heights of $11$ and $22$, $44$ and $88$, or $44$ and $22$. Checking each of these, in the first case, the average is $17.6$ meters, which doesn't end in $.2$ as the problem requires. Therefore, we consider the other cases. With $44$ and $88$, the average is $37.4$ meters, which again does not end in $.2$, but with $44$ and $22$, the average is $24.2$ meters, which does. Consequently, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }24.2}$.
