==Solution 1==
Write the order of the cars as $\square\square\square\square\square$, where the left end of the row represents the back of the train and the right end represents the front. Call the people $A$, $D$, $K$, $M$, and $S$ respectively. The first condition gives $M\square\square\square\square$, so we try $MAS\square\square$, $M\square AS\square$, and $M\square\square AS$. In the first case, as $D$ sat in front of $A$, we must have $MASDK$ or $MASKD$, which do not comply with the last condition. In the second case, we obtain $MKASD$, which works, while the third case is obviously impossible since it results in there being no way for $D$ to sit in front of $A$. It follows that, with the only possible arrangement being $MKASD$, the person sitting in the middle car is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\text{Aaron}}$.
