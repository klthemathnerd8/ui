== Problem ==
The <math>52</math> cards in a deck are numbered <math>1, 2, \cdots, 52</math>. Alex, Blair, Corey, and Dylan each picks a card from the deck without replacement and with each card being equally likely to be picked, The two persons with lower numbered cards form a team, and the two persons with higher numbered cards form another team. Let <math>p(a)</math> be the [[probability]] that Alex and Dylan are on the same team, given that Alex picks one of the cards <math>a</math> and <math>a+9</math>, and Dylan picks the other of these two cards. The minimum value of <math>p(a)</math> for which <math>p(a)\ge\frac{1}{2}</math> can be written as <math>\frac{m}{n}</math>. where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are relatively prime positive integers. Find <math>m+n</math>.
