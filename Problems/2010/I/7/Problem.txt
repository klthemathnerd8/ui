== Problem ==
Define an [[order relation|ordered]] triple <math>(A, B, C)</math> of [[set]]s to be ''minimally intersecting'' if <math>|A \cap B| = |B \cap C| = |C \cap A| = 1</math> and <math>A \cap B \cap C = \emptyset</math>. For example, <math>(\{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{1,3,4\})</math> is a minimally intersecting triple. Let <math>N</math> be the number of minimally intersecting ordered triples of sets for which each set is a subset of <math>\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}</math>. Find the remainder when <math>N</math> is divided by <math>1000</math>.

'''Note''': <math>|S|</math> represents the number of elements in the set <math>S</math>.
