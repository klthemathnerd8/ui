== Problem ==
For a real number <math>a</math>, let <math>\lfloor a \rfloor</math> denote the [[ceiling function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to <math>a</math>. Let <math>\mathcal{R}</math> denote the region in the [[coordinate plane]] consisting of points <math>(x,y)</math> such that <math>\lfloor x \rfloor ^2 + \lfloor y \rfloor ^2 = 25</math>. The region <math>\mathcal{R}</math> is completely contained in a [[disk]] of [[radius]] <math>r</math> (a disk is the union of a [[circle]] and its interior). The minimum value of <math>r</math> can be written as <math>\frac {\sqrt {m}}{n}</math>, where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are integers and <math>m</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find <math>m + n</math>.
