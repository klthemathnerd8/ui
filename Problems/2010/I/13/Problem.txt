== Problem ==
[[Rectangle]] <math>ABCD</math> and a [[semicircle]] with diameter <math>AB</math> are coplanar and have nonoverlapping interiors. Let <math>\mathcal{R}</math> denote the region enclosed by the semicircle and the rectangle. Line <math>\ell</math> meets the semicircle, segment <math>AB</math>, and segment <math>CD</math> at distinct points <math>N</math>, <math>U</math>, and <math>T</math>, respectively. Line <math>\ell</math> divides region <math>\mathcal{R}</math> into two regions with areas in the ratio <math>1: 2</math>. Suppose that <math>AU = 84</math>, <math>AN = 126</math>, and <math>UB = 168</math>. Then <math>DA</math> can be represented as <math>m\sqrt {n}</math>, where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are positive integers and <math>n</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find <math>m + n</math>.
