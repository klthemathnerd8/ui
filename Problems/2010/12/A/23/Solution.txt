== Hints and Method of Attack ==
Let $P$ be the result of dividing $90!$ by tens such that $P$ is not divisible by $10$. We want to consider $P \mod 100$. But because $100$ is not prime, and because $P$ is obviously divisible by $4$ (if in doubt, look at the answer choices), we only need to consider $P \mod 25$.

However, $25$ is a very particular number. $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \equiv -1 \text{ }(\text{mod }25)$, and so is $6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9$. How can we group terms to take advantage of this fact?

There might be a problem when you cancel out the $10$s from $90!$. One method is to cancel out a factor of $2$ from an existing number along with a factor of $5$. But this might prove cumbersome, as the grouping method will not be as effective. Instead, take advantage of ''inverses'' in modular arithmetic. Just leave the negative powers of $2$ in a "storage base," and take care of the other terms first. Then, use Fermat's Little Theorem to solve for the power of $2$.
