It should first be noted that given any quadrilateral of fixed side lengths, there is exactly one way to manipulate the angles so that the quadrilateral becomes cyclic.

'''Proof.''' Given a quadrilateral $ABCD$ where all sides are fixed (in a certain order), we can construct the diagonal $\overline{BD}$. When $BD$ is the minimum allowed by the triangle inequality, one of the angles $\angle DAB$ or $\angle BCD$ will be degenerate and measure $0^\circ$, so opposite angles will sum to less than $180^\circ$. When $BD$ is the maximum allowed, one of the angles will be degenerate and measure $180^\circ$, so opposite angles will sum to more than $180^\circ$. Thus, since the sum of opposite angles increases continuously as $BD$ is lengthened from the minimum to the maximum values, there is a unique value of $BD$ somewhere in the middle such that the sum of opposite angles is exactly $180^\circ$.

Denote $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ as the integer side lengths of the quadrilateral. Without loss of generality, let $a\ge b \ge c \ge d$.

Since $a+b+c+d = 32$, the [[Triangle Inequality]] implies that $a \le 15$.


We will now split into $5$ cases.


Case $1$: $a = b = c = d$ ($4$ side lengths are equal)

Clearly there is only $1$ way to select the side lengths $(8,8,8,8)$, and no matter how the sides are rearranged only $1$ unique quadrilateral can be formed.

Case $2$: $a = b = c > d$ or $a > b = c = d$ ($3$ side lengths are equal)

If $3$ side lengths are equal, then each of those side lengths can only be integers from $6$ to $10$ except for $8$ (because that is counted in the first case). Obviously there is still only $1$ unique quadrilateral that can be formed from one set of side lengths, resulting in a total of $4$ quadrilaterals.

Case $3$: $a = b > c = d$ ($2$ pairs of side lengths are equal)

$a$ and $b$ can be any integer from $9$ to $15$, and likewise $c$ and $d$ can be any integer from $1$ to $7$. However, a single set of side lengths can form $2$ different cyclic quadrilaterals (a rectangle and a kite), so the total number of quadrilaterals for this case is $7\cdot{2} = 14$.

Case $4$: $a = b > c > d$ or $a > b = c > d$ or $a > b > c = d$ ($2$ side lengths are equal)

If the $2$ equal side lengths are each $1$, then the other $2$ sides must each be $15$, which we have already counted in an earlier case. If the equal side lengths are each $2$, there is $1$ possible set of side lengths. Likewise, for side lengths of $3$ there are $2$ sets. Continuing this pattern, we find a total of $1+2+3+4+4+5+7+5+4+4+3+2+1 = 45$ sets of side lengths. (Be VERY careful when adding up the total for this case!) For each set of side lengths, there are $3$ possible quadrilaterals that can be formed, so the total number of quadrilaterals for this case is $3\cdot{45} = 135$.

Case $5$: $a > b > c > d$ (no side lengths are equal)
Using the same counting principles starting from $a = 15$ and eventually reaching $a = 9$, we find that the total number of possible side lengths is $69$. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the $4$ side lengths, but there is only $1$ unique quadrilateral for $4$ rotations, so the number of quadrilaterals for each set of side lengths is $\frac{4!}{4} = 6$. The total number of quadrilaterals is $6\cdot{69} = 414$.


And so, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be made is $414 + 135 + 14 + 4 + 1 = \boxed{568\ \textbf{(C)}}$.
