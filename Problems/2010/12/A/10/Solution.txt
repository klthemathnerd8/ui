== Solution 1 ==
$3p-q$ and $3p+q$ are consecutive terms, so the common difference is $(3p+q)-(3p-q) = 2q$.

$$\begin{align*}p+2q &= 9\\
9+2q &= 3p-q\\
q&=2\\
p&=5\end{align*}$$

The common difference is $4$. The first term is $5$ and the $2010^\text{th}$ term is

$$5+4(2009) = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }8041}$$
