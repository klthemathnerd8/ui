== Solution 1 ==
This problem is quickly solved with knowledge of the laws of exponents and logarithms.

$$\begin{align*} 7^{x+7} &= 8^x \\
 7^x*7^7 &= 8^x \\
 \left(\frac{8}{7}\right)^x &= 7^7 \\
 x &= \log_{8/7}7^7 \end{align*}$$

Since we are looking for the base of the logarithm, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{8}{7}}$.
