We note that $-1$ $\le$ $\sin x$ $\le$ $1$ and $-1$ $\le$ $\cos x$ $\le$ $1$. 
Therefore, there is no other way to satisfy this equation other than making both $\cos(2A-B)=1$ and $\sin(A+B)=1$, since any other way would cause one of these values to become greater than 1, which contradicts our previous statement.
From this we can easily conclude that $2A-B=0^{\circ}$ and $A+B=90^{\circ}$ and solving this system gives us $A=30^{\circ}$ and $B=60^{\circ}$. It is clear that $\triangle ABC$ is a $30^{\circ},60^{\circ},90^{\circ}$ triangle with $BC=2$　$\Longrightarrow$　$(C)$.
