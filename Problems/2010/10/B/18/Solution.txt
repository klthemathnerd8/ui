We group this into groups of $3$, because $3|2010$. This means that every residue class mod 3 has an equal probability.

If $3|a$, we are done. There is a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ that that happens.

Otherwise, we have $3|bc+b+1$, which means that $b(c+1) \equiv 2\pmod{3}$. So either $$b \equiv 1 \pmod{3}, c \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$$ or $$b \equiv 2 \pmod {3}, c \equiv 0 \pmod 3$$ which will lead to the property being true. There is a $\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{9}$ chance for each bundle of cases to be true. Thus, the total for the cases is $\frac{2}{9}$. But we have to multiply by $\frac{2}{3}$ because this only happens with a $\frac{2}{3}$ chance. So the total is actually $\frac{4}{27}$.

The grand total is $$\frac{1}{3} + \frac{4}{27} = \boxed{\text{(E) }\frac{13}{27}.}$$
