The average of two numbers, $a$ and $b$, is defined as $\frac{a+b}{2}$. Thus the average of $x$ and $x^2$ would be $\frac{x(x+1)}{2}$. With that said,  we need to find the sum when we plug, $1$, $2$ and $3$ into that equation. So:


$$\frac{1(1+1)}{2} + \frac{2(2+1)}{2} + \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{6}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = 1+3+6= \boxed{\textbf{(C)} 10}$$
