==Solution==
You need $2$ dimes, $1$ nickel, and $4$ pennies for the first $25$ cents. From $26$ cents to $50$ cents, you only need to add $1$ quarter. From $51$ cents to $75$ cents, you also only need to add $1$ quarter. The same for $76$ cents to $99$ cents. Notice that instead of $100$, it is $99$. We are left with $3$ quarters, $1$ nickel, $2$ dimes, and $4$ pennies. Thus, the correct answer is $3+2+1+4=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 10}$.
