==Solution 1==
Every integer value of $y$ leads to an integer solution for $x$
Since $y$ must be positive, $y\geq 1$

Also, $y = \frac{100-x}{2}$
Since $x$ must be positive, $y < 50$

$1 \leq y < 50$
This leaves $49$ values for y, which mean there are $49$ solutions to the equation $\Rightarrow \mathrm{(B)}$
