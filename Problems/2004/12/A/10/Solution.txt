===Solution 1=== 
The median of a sequence is the middle number of the sequence when the sequence is arranged in order. Since the integers are consecutive, the median is also the [[mean]], so the median is $\frac{7^5}{49} = 7^3\ \mathrm{(C)}$.

===Solution 2===
Notice that $49\cdot7^3=7^5$. So, our middle number (median) must be $ 7^3\ \mathrm{(C)}$ since all the other terms can be grouped to form an additional $48$ copies $7^3$. Adding them would give $7^5$.
