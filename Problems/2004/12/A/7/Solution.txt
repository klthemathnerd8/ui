===Solution 1===
We look at a set of three rounds, where the players begin with $x+1$, $x$, and $x-1$ tokens.
After three rounds, there will be a net loss of $1$ token per player (they receive two tokens and lose three). Therefore, after $36$ rounds -- or $12$ three-round sets, $A,B$ and $C$ will have $3$, $2$, and $1$ tokens, respectively.  After $1$ more round, player $A$ will give away $3$ tokens, leaving them empty-handed, and thus the game will end. We then have there are $36+1=\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 37}$ rounds until the game ends.

===Solution 2===

Let's bash a few rounds. The amounts are for players $1,2,$ and $3$, respectively.

First round: $15,14,13$ (given)
Second round: $12,15,14$
Third round: $13,12,15$
Fourth round: $14,13,12$

We see that after $3$ rounds are played, we have the exact same scenario as the first round but with one token less per player. So, the sequence $1,4,7,10...$ where each of the next members are $3$ greater than the previous one corresponds with the sequence $15,14,13,12...$ where the first sequence represents the round and the second sequence represents the number of tokens player $1$ has. But we note that once player $1$ reaches $3$ coins, the game will end on his next turn as he must give away all his coins. Therefore, we want the $15-3+1=13$th number in the sequence $1,4,7,10...$ which is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 37}$.

===Solution 3===

Looking at a set of five rounds, you'll see $A$ has $4$ fewer tokens than in the beginning. Looking at four more rounds, you'll notice $A$ has the same amount of tokens, namely $11$, compared to round five. If you keep doing this process, you'll see a pattern: Every four rounds, the amount of tokens $A$ has either decreased by $4$ or stayed the same compared to the previous four rounds. For example, in round nine, $A$ had $11$ tokens, in round $13$, $A$ had $11$ tokens, and in round $17$, $A$ had $7$ tokens, etc. Using this weird pattern, you can find out that in round $37$, $A$ should have $3$ tokens, but since they would have given them away in that round, the game would end on $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 37}$.

This strategy is a very slow one, requiring you to list out about $25$ rounds.
