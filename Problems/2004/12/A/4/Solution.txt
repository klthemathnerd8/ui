=== Solution 1 ===
Since Bertha has $6$ daughters, she has $30-6=24$ granddaughters, of which none have daughters.  Of Bertha's daughters, $\frac{24}6=4$ have daughters, so $6-4=2$ do not have daughters. Therefore, of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters, $24+2=26$ do not have daughters.  $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 26}$

=== Solution 2 (From Alcumus) ===
Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \boxed{26}$.

=== Solution 3 ===
Draw a tree diagram and see that the answer can be found in the sum of $6+6$ granddaughters, $5+5$ daughters, and $4$ more daughters.  Adding them together gives the answer of $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 26}$.
