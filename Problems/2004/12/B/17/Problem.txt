== Problem ==
For some real numbers $a$ and $b$, the [[equation]]
$$8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0$$
has three distinct positive roots. If the sum of the base-$2$ [[logarithm]]s of the roots is $5$, what is the value of $a$? 

$\mathrm{(A)}\ -256
\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ -64 
\qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ -8
\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 64 
\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 256$
