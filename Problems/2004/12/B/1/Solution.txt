== Solution ==
Each day Jenny makes half as many free throws as she does at the next practice. Hence on the fourth day she made $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 48 = 24$ free throws, on the third $12$, on the second $6$, and on the first $3 \Rightarrow \mathrm{(A)}$.

Because there are five days, or four transformations between days (day 1 $\rightarrow$ day 2 $\rightarrow$ day 3 $\rightarrow$ day 4 $\rightarrow$ day 5), she makes $48 \cdot \frac{1}{2^4} = \boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 3}$
