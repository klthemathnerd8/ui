== Solution ==

Let the number of students be $n\geq 5$. Then the sum of their scores is at least $5\cdot 100 + (n-5)\cdot 60$. At the same time, we need to achieve the mean $76$, which is equivalent to achieving the sum $76n$.

Hence we get a necessary condition on $n$: we must have $5\cdot 100 + (n-5)\cdot 60 \leq 76n$.
This can be simplified to $200 \leq 16n$. The smallest integer $n$ for which this is true is $n=13$.

To finish our solution, we now need to find one way how $13$ students could have scored on the test. We have $13\cdot 76 = 988$ points to divide among them. The five $100$s make $500$, hence we must divide the remaining $488$ points among the other $8$ students. This can be done e.g. by giving $61$ points to each of them. 

Hence the smallest possible number of students is $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 13}$.
