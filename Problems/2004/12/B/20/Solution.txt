There are $2^6$ possible colorings of the cube. Consider the color that appears with greater frequency. The property obviously holds true if $5$ or $6$ of the faces are colored the same, which for each color can happen in $6 + 1 = 7$ ways. If $4$ of the faces are colored the same, there are $3$ possible cubes (corresponding to the $3$ possible ways to pick pairs of opposite faces for the other color). If $3$ of the faces are colored the same, the property obviously cannot be satisfied. Thus, there are a total of $2(7 + 3) = 20$ ways for this to occur, and the desired probability is $\frac{20}{2^6} = \frac{5}{16}\ \mathbf{(B)}$.
