== Solution ==

The directions "southwest" and "southeast" are orthogonal. Thus the described situation is a right triangle with legs $8$ miles and $10$ miles long. The hypotenuse length is $\sqrt{8^2 + 10^2}\approx12.8$, and thus the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 13}$.

Without a calculator one can note that $8^2+10^2=164<169=13^2\Rightarrow\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 13}$.
