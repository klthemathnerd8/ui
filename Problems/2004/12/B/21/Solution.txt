$\frac yx$ represents the slope of a line passing through the origin. It follows that since a line $y = mx$ intersects the ellipse at either $0, 1,$ or $2$ points, the minimum and maximum are given when the line $y = mx$ is a tangent, with only one point of intersection. Substituting,
$$2x^2 + x(mx) + 3(mx)^2 - 11x - 20(mx) + 40 = 0$$
Rearranging by the degree of $x$,
$$(3m^2 + m + 2)x^2 - (20m + 11)x + 40 = 0$$
Since the line $y=mx$ is tangent to the ellipse, we want the discriminant, 
$$(20m+11)^2 - 4\cdot 40 \cdot (3m^2 + m + 2) = -80m^2 + 280m - 199 $$
to be equal to $0$. We want $a+b$, which is the sum of the roots of the above quadratic. By [[Vietaâ€™s formulas]], that is $\frac{280}{80} = \frac{7}{2} \Rightarrow \mathrm{(C)}$.
