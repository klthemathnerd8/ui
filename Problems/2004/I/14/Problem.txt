== Problem ==
A unicorn is tethered by a <math>20</math>-foot silver rope to the base of a magician's [[cylinder|cylindrical]] tower whose [[radius]] is <math>8</math> feet. The rope is attached to the tower at ground level and to the unicorn at a height of <math>4</math> feet. The unicorn has pulled the rope taut, the end of the rope is <math>4</math> feet from the nearest point on the tower, and the length of the rope that is touching the tower is <math> \frac{a-\sqrt{b}}c </math> feet, where <math> a, b, </math> and <math> c </math> are [[positive]] [[integer]]s, and <math> c </math> is prime. Find <math> a+b+c. </math>
