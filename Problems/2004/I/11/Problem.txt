== Problem ==
A [[solid]] in the shape of a right circular [[cone]] is 4 inches tall and its base has a 3-inch radius. The entire [[surface]] of the cone, including its base, is painted. A [[plane]] [[parallel]] to the base of the cone divides the cone into two solids, a smaller cone-shaped solid <math> C </math> and a [[frustum]]-shaped solid <math> F, </math> in such a way that the [[ratio]] between the [[area]]s of the painted surfaces of <math> C </math> and <math> F </math> and the ratio between the [[volume]]s of <math> C </math> and <math> F </math> are both equal to <math> k</math>. Given that <math> k=\frac m n, </math> where <math> m </math> and <math> n </math> are [[relatively prime]] [[positive integer]]s, find <math> m+n. </math>
