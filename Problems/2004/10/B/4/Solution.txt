== Solution 1 ==

The product of all six numbers is $6!=720$. The products of numbers that can be visible are $720/1$, $720/2$, ..., $720/6$.
The answer to this problem is their greatest common divisor -- which is $720/L$, where $L$ is the least common multiple of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
Clearly $L=60$ and the answer is $720/60=\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 12}$.
