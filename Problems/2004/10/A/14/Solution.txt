=== Solution 1 ===

Let the total value, in cents, of the coins Paula has originally be $v$, and the number of coins she has be $n$. Then $\frac{v}{n}=20\Longrightarrow v=20n$ and $\frac{v+25}{n+1}=21$. Substituting yields: $20n+25=21(n+1),$ so $n=4$, $v = 80.$  Then, we see that the only way Paula can satisfy this rule is if she had $3$ quarters and $1$ nickel in her purse. Thus, she has $\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 0}$ dimes.

=== Solution 2 ===

If the new coin was worth $20$ cents, adding it would not change the mean. The additional $5$ cents raise the mean by $1$, thus the new number of coins must be $5$. Therefore there were $4$ coins worth a total of $4\times20=80$ cents. As in the previous solution, we conclude that the only way to get $80$ cents using $4$ coins is $25+25+25+5$. Thus, having three quarters, one nickel, and no dimes $\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 0}.$
