== Problem ==
A jar has <math>10</math> red candies and <math>10</math> blue candies. Terry picks two candies at random, then Mary picks two of the remaining candies at random. Given that the [[probability]] that they get the same color combination, irrespective of order, is <math> m/n, </math> where <math> m </math> and <math> n </math> are [[relatively prime]] [[positive integer]]s, find <math> m+n. </math>
