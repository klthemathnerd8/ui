== Problem ==
A [[sequence]] of positive integers with <math> a_1=1 </math> and <math> a_9+a_{10}=646 </math> is formed so that the first three terms are in [[geometric sequence|geometric progression]], the second, third, and fourth terms are in [[arithmetic sequence|arithmetic progression]], and, in general, for all <math> n\ge1, </math> the terms <math> a_{2n-1}, a_{2n}, a_{2n+1} </math> are in geometric progression, and the terms <math> a_{2n}, a_{2n+1}, </math> and <math> a_{2n+2} </math> are in arithmetic progression. Let <math> a_n </math> be the greatest term in this sequence that is less than <math>1000</math>. Find <math> n+a_n. </math>
