== Solution ==
Denote the number of bananas the first monkey took from the pile as <math>b_1</math>, the second <math>b_2</math>, and the third <math>b_3</math>; the total is <math>b_1 + b_2 + b_3</math>. Thus, the first monkey got <math>\frac{3}{4}b_1 + \frac{3}{8}b_2 + \frac{11}{24}b_3</math>, the second monkey got <math>\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \frac{1}{4}b_2 + \frac{11}{24}b_3</math>, and the third monkey got <math>\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \frac{3}{8}b_2 + \frac{1}{12}b_3</math>. 

Taking into account the ratio aspect, say that the third monkey took <math>x</math> bananas in total. Then,

<math>x = \frac{1}{4}b_1 + \frac{1}{8}b_2 + \frac{11}{72}b_3 = \frac{1}{16}b_1 + \frac{1}{8}b_2 + \frac{11}{48}b_3 = \frac{1}{8}b_1 + \frac{3}{8}b_2 + \frac{1}{12}b_3</math>

Solve this to find that <math>\frac{b_1}{11} = \frac{b_2}{13} = \frac{b_3}{27}</math>. All three fractions must be integral. Also note some other conditions we have picked up in the course of the problem, namely that <math>b_1</math> is divisible by <math>8</math>, <math>b_2</math> is divisible by <math>8</math>, and <math>b_3</math> is divisible by <math>72</math> (however, since the denominator contains a <math>27</math>, the factors of <math>3</math> cancel, and it only really needs to be divisible by <math>8</math>). Thus, the minimal value is when each fraction is equal to <math>8</math>, and the solution is <math>8(11 + 13 + 27) = \boxed{408}</math>.
