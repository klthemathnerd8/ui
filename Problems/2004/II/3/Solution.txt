== Solution ==
The <math>231</math> cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes.  Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension.  If the original block has dimensions <math>l \times m \times n</math>, we must have <math>(l - 1)\times(m-1) \times(n - 1) = 231</math>.  The [[prime factorization]] of <math>231 = 3\cdot7\cdot11</math>, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, <math>l - 1 = 1</math> and <math>m - 1 = 11</math> and <math>n - 1 = 3 \cdot 7</math>, among others.  However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize <math>l\cdot m\cdot n</math> is to make <math>l</math> and <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is <math>3 \times 7 \times 11</math>.  Then the extra layer makes the entire block <math>4\times8\times12</math>, and <math>N= \boxed{384}</math>.

An alternate way to visualize the problem is to count the blocks that can be seen and subtract the blocks that cannot be seen.  In the given block with dimensions <math>l\times m \times n</math>, the three faces have <math>lm</math>, <math>mn</math>, and <math>ln</math> blocks each.  However, <math>l</math> blocks along the first edge, <math>m</math> blocks along the second edge, and <math>n</math> blocks along the third edge were counted twice, so they must be subtracted.  After subtracting these three edges, 1 block has not been counted - it was added three times on each face, but subtracted three times on each side.  Thus, the total number of visible cubes is <math>lm+mn+ln-l-m-n+1</math>, and the total number of invisible cubes is <math>lmn-lm-mn-ln+l+m+n-1</math>, which can be factored into <math>(l-1)(m-1)(n-1)</math>.
