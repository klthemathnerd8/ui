==Problem==

Niki usually leaves her cell phone on. If her cell phone is on but
she is not actually using it, the battery will last for $24$ hours. If
she is using it constantly, the battery will last for only $3$ hours.
Since the last recharge, her phone has been on $9$ hours, and during
that time she has used it for $60$ minutes. If she doesnâ€™t use it any
more but leaves the phone on, how many more hours will the battery last?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 7 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 8 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 11 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 14 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 15$
