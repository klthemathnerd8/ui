Note that the prime factorization of the product is <math>3^{2}\cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 17 \cdot 31 \cdot 41 \cdot 61</math>. Ignoring overcounting, by stars and bars there are <math>6</math> ways to choose how to distribute the factors of <math>3</math>, and <math>3</math> ways to distribute the factors of the other primes, so we have <math>3^{6} \cdot 6</math> ways. However, some sets have <math>2</math> numbers that are the same, namely the ones in the form <math>1,1,x</math> and <math>3,3,x</math>, which are each counted <math>3</math> times, and each other set is counted <math>6</math> times, so the desired answer is <math>\dfrac{729 \cdot 6-6}{6} = \boxed{728}</math>.
