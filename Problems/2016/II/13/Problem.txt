==Problem==
Beatrix is going to place six rooks on a <math>6 \times 6</math> chessboard where both the rows and columns are labeled <math>1</math> to <math>6</math>; the rooks are placed so that no two rooks are in the same row or the same column. The <math>value</math> of a square is the sum of its row number and column number. The <math>score</math> of an arrangement of rooks is the least value of any occupied square.The average score over all valid configurations is <math>\frac{p}{q}</math>, where <math>p</math> and <math>q</math> are relatively prime positive integers. Find <math>p+q</math>.
