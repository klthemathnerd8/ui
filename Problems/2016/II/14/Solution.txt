==Solution 1==
The inradius of <math>\triangle ABC</math> is <math>100\sqrt 3</math> and the circumradius is <math>200 \sqrt 3</math>. Now, consider the line perpendicular to plane <math>ABC</math> through the circumcenter of <math>\triangle ABC</math>. Note that <math>P,Q,O</math> must lie on that line to be equidistant from each of the triangle's vertices. Also, note that since <math>P, Q, O</math> are collinear, and <math>OP=OQ</math>, we must have <math>O</math> is the midpoint of <math>PQ</math>.  Now, Let <math>K</math> be the circumcenter of <math>\triangle ABC</math>, and <math>L</math> be the foot of the altitude from <math>A</math> to <math>BC</math>. We must have <math>\tan(\angle KLP+ \angle QLK)= \tan(120^{\circ})</math>. Setting <math>KP=x</math> and <math>KQ=y</math>, assuming WLOG <math>x>y</math>, we must have <math>\tan(120^{\circ})=-\sqrt{3}=\dfrac{\dfrac{x+y}{100 \sqrt{3}}}{\dfrac{30000-xy}{30000}}</math>. Therefore, we must have <math>100(x+y)=xy-30000</math>. Also, we must have <math>\left(\dfrac{x+y}{2}\right)^{2}=\left(\dfrac{x-y}{2}\right)^{2}+120000</math> by the Pythagorean theorem, so we have <math>xy=120000</math>, so substituting into the other equation we have <math>90000=100(x+y)</math>, or <math>x+y=900</math>. Since we want <math>\dfrac{x+y}{2}</math>, the desired answer is <math>\boxed{450}</math>.
