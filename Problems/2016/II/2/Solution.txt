==Solution 1==
Let <math>x</math> be the probability that it rains on Sunday given that it doesn't rain on Saturday. We then have <math>\dfrac{3}{5}x+\dfrac{2}{5}2x = \dfrac{3}{10} \implies \dfrac{7}{5}x=\dfrac{3}{10}</math> <math> \implies x=\dfrac{3}{14}</math>. Therefore, the probability that it doesn't rain on either day is <math>\left(1-\dfrac{3}{14}\right)\left(\dfrac{3}{5}\right)=\dfrac{33}{70}</math>. Therefore, the probability that rains on at least one of the days is <math>1-\dfrac{33}{70}=\dfrac{37}{70}</math>, so adding up the <math>2</math> numbers, we have <math>37+70=\boxed{107}</math>.
