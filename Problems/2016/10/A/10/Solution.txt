Let the length of the inner rectangle be $x$.

Then the area of that rectangle is $x\cdot1 = x$.

The second largest rectangle has dimensions of $x+2$ and $3$, making its area $3x+6$. The area of the second shaded area, therefore, is $3x+6-x = 2x+6$.

The largest rectangle has dimensions of $x+4$ and $5$, making its area $5x + 20$. The area of the largest shaded region is the largest rectangle minus the second largest rectangle, which is $(5x+20) - (3x+6) = 2x + 14$.

The problem states that $x, 2x+6, 2x+14$ is an arithmetic progression, meaning that the terms in the sequence increase by the same amount each term.

Therefore,
$(2x+6) - (x) = (2x+14) - (2x+6)\implies
x+6 = 8\implies
x =2\implies \boxed{\textbf B}$
