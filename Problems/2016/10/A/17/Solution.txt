==Solution 1==
Let $n = \frac{N}{5}$. Then, consider $5$ blocks of $n$ green balls in a line, along with the red ball. Shuffling the line is equivalent to choosing one of the $N + 1$ positions between the green balls to insert the red ball. Less than $\frac{3}{5}$ of the green balls will be on the same side of the red ball if the red ball is inserted inside the middle block of $n$ balls, and there are $n - 1$ positions where this happens. Thus, $P(N) = 1 - \frac{n - 1}{N + 1} = \frac{4n + 2}{5n + 1}$, so

$$P(N) = \frac{4n + 2}{5n + 1} < \frac{321}{400}.$$

Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $400(5n+1)$, we have

$$400(4n+2)<321(5n+1),$$

and by the distributive property,

$$1600n+800<1605n+321.$$

Subtracting $1600n+321$ on both sides of the inequality gives us

$$479<5n.$$

Therefore, $N=5n>479$, so the least possible value of $N$ is $480$. The sum of the digits of $480$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 12}$.
