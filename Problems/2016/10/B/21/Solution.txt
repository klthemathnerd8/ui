==Solution 1==
Without loss of generality (WLOG) note that if a point in the first quadrant satisfies the equation, so do its corresponding points in the other three quadrants. Therefore, we can assume that $x, y \ge 0$, which implies that $|x|=x$ and $|y|=y$, and multiply by $4$ at the end.

We can rearrange the equation to get $x^2-x+y^2-y=0 \Rightarrow (x-\tfrac12)^2+(y-\tfrac12)^2=(\tfrac{\sqrt2}{2})^2$, which describes a circle with center $(\tfrac12, \tfrac12)$ and radius $\tfrac{\sqrt2}{2}.$ It's clear we now want to find the union of four equal areas.

There are several ways to find the area, but note that if you connect $(0, 1)$ to its other three respective points in the other three quadrants, you get a square of area $2$, along with four half-circles of diameter $\sqrt{2}$, for a total area of $2+2\cdot(\tfrac{\sqrt2}{2})^2\pi = \pi + 2$ which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
