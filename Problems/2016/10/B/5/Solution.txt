The sum of the ages of the cousins is $4$ times the mean, or $32$.
There are an even number of cousins, so there is no single median, so $5$ must be the mean of the two in the middle.
Therefore the sum of the ages of the two in the middle is $10$. Subtracting $10$ from $32$ produces $\textbf{(D)}\ \boxed{22}$.
