==Solution 1==
We can set up a system of equations where $a$ is the sets of twins, $b$ is the sets of triplets, and $c$ is the sets of quadruplets.
$$\begin{split}
2a + 3b + 4c & = 1000 \\
b & = 4c \\
a & = 3b
\end{split}$$

Solving for $c$ and $a$ in the second and third equations and substituting into the first equation yields
$$\begin{split}
2 (3b) + 3b + 4 (0.25b) & = 1000 \\
6b + 3b + b & = 1000 \\
b & = 100
\end{split}$$

Since we are trying to find the number of babies and '''NOT''' the number of sets of quadruplets, the solution is not $c$, but rather $4c$. Therefore, we strategically use the second initial equation to realize that $b$ $=$ $4c$, leaving us with the number of babies born as quadruplets equal to $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 100}$.
