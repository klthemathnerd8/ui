==Solution 1==

The equation $x^2(x+y+1)=y^2(x+y+1)$ tells us $x^2=y^2$ or $x+y+1=0$ . $x^2=y^2$ generates two lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ . $x+y+1=0$ is another straight line. The only intersection of $y=x$ and $y=-x$ is $(0,0)$ , which is not on $x+y+1=0$ . Therefore, the graph is three lines that do not have a common intersection, or $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\; \text{three lines that do not all pass through a common point}}$
