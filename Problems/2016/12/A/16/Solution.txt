Setting the first two equations equal to each other, $\log_3 x = \log_x 3$.

Solving this, we get $\left(3, 1\right)$ and $\left(\frac{1}{3}, -1\right)$.

Similarly with the last two equations, we get $\left(3, -1\right)$ and $\left(\frac{1}{3}, 1\right)$.

Now, by setting the first and third equations equal to each other, we get $\left(1, 0\right)$.

Pairing the first and fourth or second and third equations won't work because then $\log x \leq 0$.

Pairing the second and fourth equations will yield $x = 1$, but since you can't divide by $\log 1 = 0$, it doesn't work.

After trying all pairs, we have a total of $5$ solutions $\rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(D)} 5}$
