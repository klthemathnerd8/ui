== Solution 1 ==

We see that $a \, \diamondsuit \, a = 1$, and think of division. Testing, we see that the first condition $a \, \diamondsuit \, (b \, \diamondsuit \, c) = (a \, \diamondsuit \, b) \cdot c$ is satisfied, because $\frac{a}{\frac{b}{c}} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot c$. Therefore, division can be the operation $\diamondsuit$. Solving the equation, $$\frac{2016}{\frac{6}{x}} = \frac{2016}{6} \cdot x = 336x = 100\implies x=\frac{100}{336} = \frac{25}{84},$$ so the answer is $25 + 84 = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }109}$.
