==Solution==
In this case, a counterexample is a number that would prove Goldbach's conjecture false. The conjecture asserts what '''can''' be done with '''even''' integers greater than 2.
Therefore the solution is $${\textbf{(E)}\text{ an even integer greater than 2 that cannot be written as the sum of two prime numbers.}}$$
