==Solution 1==

We set up equations to find each angle. The larger angle will be represented as $x$ and the smaller angle will be represented as $y$, in degrees. This implies that 

$4x=5y$

and

$2\times(90-x)=90-y$

since the larger the original angle, the smaller the complement.

We then find that $x=75$ and $y=60$, and their sum is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 135}$
