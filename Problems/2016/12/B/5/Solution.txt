To find what day of the week it is in $919$ days, we have to divide $919$ by $7$ to see the remainder, and then add the remainder to the current day. We get that $\frac{919}{7}$ has a remainder of 2, so we increase the current day by $2$ to get $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \text{Saturday}}$.

Note that the dates themselves (and thus leap years) can be ignored, as we only need the number of days that passed to figure out the day of the week.
