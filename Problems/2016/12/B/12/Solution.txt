Solution by Mlux:
Draw a $3\times3$ matrix. Notice that no adjacent numbers could be in the corners since two consecutive numbers must share an edge. Now find 4 nonconsecutive numbers that add up to $18$. Trying $1+3+5+9 = 18$ works. Place each odd number in the corner in a clockwise order. Then fill in the spaces. There has to be a $2$ in between the $1$ and $3$. There is a $4$ between $3$ and $5$.  The final grid should similar to this.

$\newline
1, 2,  3\newline
8,  7, 4\newline
9,  6,  5$

$\textbf{(C)}7$ is in the middle.
