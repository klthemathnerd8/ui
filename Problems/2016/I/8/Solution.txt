To minimize <math>s(p)</math>, the numbers <math>1</math>, <math>2</math>, and <math>3</math> (which sum to <math>6</math>) must be in the hundreds places.  For the units digit of <math>s(p)</math> to be <math>0</math>, the numbers in the ones places must have a sum of either <math>10</math> or <math>20</math>. However, since the tens digit contributes more to the final sum <math>s(p)</math> than the ones digit, and we are looking for the minimum value of <math>s(p)</math>, we take the sum's units digit to be <math>20</math>. We know that the sum of the numbers in the tens digits is <math>\sum\limits_{i=1}^9 (i) -6-20=45-6-20=19</math>. Therefore, <math>m=100\times6+10\times19+20=810</math>.

To find <math>n</math>, realize that there are <math>3!=6</math> ways of ordering the numbers in each of the places.  Additionally, there are three possibilities for the numbers in the ones place: <math>(4,7,9)</math>, <math>(5,7,8)</math>, and <math>(5,6,9)</math>.  Therefore there are <math>6^3\times3=648</math> ways in total. <math>|m-n|=|810-648|=\fbox{162}</math>.
