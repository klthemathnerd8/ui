==Solution 1==
Let <math>d</math> be the number of days Anh reads for.  Because the difference between the number of pages and minutes Anh reads for each day stays constant and is an integer, <math>d</math> must be a factor of the total difference, which is <math>374-319=55</math>.  Also note that the number of pages Anh reads is <math>dn+\frac{d(d-1)}{2}</math>.  Similarly, the number of minutes she reads for is <math>dt+\frac{d(d-1)}{2}</math>.  When <math>d</math> is odd (which it must be), both of these numbers are multiples of <math>d</math>.  Therefore, <math>d</math> must be a factor of <math>55</math>, <math>319</math>, and <math>374</math>.  The only such numbers are <math>1</math> and <math>11</math>.  We know that Anh reads for at least <math>2</math> days. Therefore, <math>d=11</math>.

Using this, we find that she reads <math>55</math> "additional" pages and <math>55</math> "additional" minutes.  Therefore, <math>n=\frac{374-55}{11}=29</math>, while <math>t=\frac{319-55}{11}=24</math>.  The answer is therefore <math>29+24=\fbox{053}</math>.
