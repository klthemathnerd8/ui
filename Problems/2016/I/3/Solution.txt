Think about each plane independently. From the top vertex, we can go down to any of 5 different points in the second plane. From that point, there are 9 ways to go to another point within the second plane: rotate as many as 4 points clockwise or as many 4 counterclockwise, or stay in place.  Then, there are 2 paths from that point down to the third plane.  Within the third plane, there are 9 paths as well (consider the logic from the second plane).  Finally, there is only one way down to the bottom vertex.  Therefore there are <math>5 \cdot 9 \cdot 2 \cdot 9 \cdot 1=\boxed{810}</math> paths.
