First note that <math>1001 = 143 \cdot 7</math> and <math>429 = 143 \cdot 3</math> so every point of the form <math>(7k, 3k)</math> is on the line.   Then consider the line <math>l</math> from <math>(7k, 3k)</math> to <math>(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))</math>.  Translate the line <math>l</math> so that <math>(7k, 3k)</math> is now the origin.   There is one square and one circle that intersect the line around <math>(0,0)</math>.  Then the points on <math>l</math> with an integral <math>x</math>-coordinate are, since <math>l</math> has the equation <math>y = \frac{3x}{7}</math>:

<cmath>  (0,0), \left(1, \frac{3}{7}\right), \left(2, \frac{6}{7}\right), \left(3, 1 + \frac{2}{7}\right), \left(4, 1 + \frac{5}{7}\right), \left(5, 2 + \frac{1}{7}\right), \left(6, 2 + \frac{4}{7}\right), (7,3). </cmath>

We claim that the lower right vertex of the square centered at <math>(2,1)</math> lies on <math>l</math>.  Since the square has side length <math>\frac{1}{5}</math>, the lower right vertex of this square has coordinates <math>\left(2 + \frac{1}{10},  1 - \frac{1}{10}\right) = \left(\frac{21}{10}, \frac{9}{10}\right)</math>.  Because <math>\frac{9}{10} = \frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{21}{10}</math>, <math>\left(\frac{21}{10}, \frac{9}{10}\right)</math> lies on <math>l</math>.  Since the circle centered at <math>(2,1)</math> is contained inside the square, this circle does not intersect <math>l</math>.  Similarly the upper left vertex of the square centered at <math>(5,2)</math> is on <math>l</math>.  Since every other point listed above is farther away from a lattice point (excluding (0,0) and (7,3)) and there are two squares with centers strictly between <math>(0,0)</math> and <math>(7,3)</math> that intersect <math>l</math>.  Since there are <math>\frac{1001}{7} = \frac{429}{3} = 143</math> segments from <math>(7k, 3k)</math> to <math>(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))</math>, the above count is yields <math>143 \cdot 2 = 286</math> squares.  Since every lattice point on <math>l</math> is of the form <math>(3k, 7k)</math> where <math>0 \le k \le 143</math>, there are <math>144</math> lattice points on <math>l</math>. Centered at each lattice point, there is one square and one circle, hence this counts <math>288</math> squares and circles.  Thus <math>m + n = 286 + 288 = \boxed{574}</math>.
