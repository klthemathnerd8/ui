== Solution 1 ==

Let $x^2 = \frac{n}{20-n} $, with $x \ge 0$ (note that the solutions $x < 0$ do not give any additional solutions for $n$). Then rewriting, $n = \frac{20x^2}{x^2 + 1}$. Since $\text{gcd}(x^2, x^2 + 1) = 1$, it follows that $x^2 + 1$ divides $20$. Listing the factors of $20$, we find that $x = 0, 1, 2 , 3$ are the only $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 4}$ solutions (respectively yielding $n = 0, 10, 16, 18$).
