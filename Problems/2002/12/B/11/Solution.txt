Since $A-B$ and $A+B$ must have the same [[parity]], and since there is only one even prime number, it follows that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd. Thus one of $A, B$ is odd and the other even. Since $A+B > A > A-B > 2$, it follows that $A$ (as a prime greater than $2$) is odd. Thus $B = 2$, and $A-2, A, A+2$ are consecutive odd primes. At least one of $A-2, A, A+2$ is divisible by $3$, from which it follows that $A-2 = 3$ and $A = 5$. The sum of these numbers is thus $17$, a prime, so the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ \text{prime}}$.
