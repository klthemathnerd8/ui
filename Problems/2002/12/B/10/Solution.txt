==Solution 1==
Subtracting 10 from each number in the set, and dividing the results by 3, we obtain the set $\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\}$.  It is easy to see that we can get any integer between $-6$ and $6$ inclusive as the sum of three elements from this set, for the total of $\boxed{\mathrm{(A) } 13}$ integers.
