Clearly $BC=5$ and $AC=5\sqrt{3}$. Choose a $P'$ and get a corresponding $D'$ such that $BD'= 5\sqrt{2}$ and $CD'=5$. For $ BD > 5\sqrt2 $ we need $CD>5$, creating an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse $5\sqrt {2}$ . Thus the point $P$ may only lie in the triangle $ABD'$. The probability of it doing so is the ratio of areas of $ABD'$ to $ABC$, or equivalently, the ratio of $AD'$ to $AC$ because the triangles have identical altitudes when taking $AD'$ and $AC$ as bases. This ratio is equal to $\frac{AC-CD'}{AC}=1-\frac{CD'}{AC}=1-\frac{5}{5\sqrt{3}}=1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}= \frac{3-\sqrt{3}}{3}$. Thus the answer is $\boxed{C}$.
