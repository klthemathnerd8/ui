== Solution ==

Neither of the digits $4$, $6$, and $8$ can be a units digit of a prime. Therefore the sum of the set is at least $40 + 60 + 80 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 207$.

We can indeed create a set of primes with this sum, for example the following sets work: $\{ 41, 67, 89, 2, 3, 5 \}$ or $\{ 43, 61, 89, 2, 5, 7 \}$.

Thus the answer is $207\implies \boxed{\mathrm{(B)}}$.
