== Problem ==
Circles <math>\mathcal{C}_{1}</math> and <math>\mathcal{C}_{2}</math> intersect at two points, one of which is <math>(9,6)</math>, and the product of the radii is <math>68</math>. The x-axis and the line <math>y = mx</math>, where <math>m > 0</math>, are tangent to both circles. It is given that <math>m</math> can be written in the form <math>a\sqrt {b}/c</math>, where <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> are positive integers, <math>b</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime, and <math>a</math> and <math>c</math> are relatively prime. Find <math>a + b + c</math>.
