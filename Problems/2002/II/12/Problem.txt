== Problem ==
A basketball player has a constant probability of <math>.4</math> of making any given shot, independent of previous shots. Let <math>a_n</math> be the ratio of shots made to shots attempted after <math>n</math> shots. The probability that <math>a_{10} = .4</math> and <math>a_n\le.4</math> for all <math>n</math> such that <math>1\le n\le9</math> is given to be <math>p^aq^br/\left(s^c\right)</math> where <math>p</math>, <math>q</math>, <math>r</math>, and <math>s</math> are primes, and <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> are positive integers. Find <math>\left(p+q+r+s\right)\left(a+b+c\right)</math>.
