== Problem ==
While finding the sine of a certain angle, an absent-minded professor failed to notice that his calculator was not in the correct angular mode. He was lucky to get the right answer. The two least positive real values of <math>x</math> for which the sine of <math>x</math> degrees is the same as the sine of <math>x</math> radians are <math>\frac{m\pi}{n-\pi}</math> and <math>\frac{p\pi}{q+\pi}</math>, where <math>m</math>, <math>n</math>, <math>p</math>, and <math>q</math> are positive integers. Find <math>m+n+p+q</math>.
