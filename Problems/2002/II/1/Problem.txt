Given that<br>
<cmath>\begin{eqnarray*}&(1)& x\text{ and }y\text{ are both integers between 100 and 999, inclusive;}\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \\
    &(2)& y\text{ is the number formed by reversing the digits of }x\text{; and}\\
    &(3)& z=|x-y|.
\end{eqnarray*}</cmath>

How many distinct values of <math>z</math> are possible?
