== Problem ==
The diagram shows twenty congruent [[circle]]s arranged in three rows and enclosed in a rectangle. The circles are tangent to one another and to the sides of the rectangle as shown in the diagram. The [[ratio]] of the longer dimension of the rectangle to the shorter dimension can be written as <math>\dfrac{1}{2}(\sqrt{p}-q)</math> where <math>p</math> and <math>q</math> are positive integers. Find <math>p+q</math>.
