== Problem ==
Jane is 25 years old. Dick is older than Jane. In <math>n</math> years, where <math>n</math> is a positive integer, Dick's age and Jane's age will both be two-digit numbers and will have the property that Jane's age is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age. Let <math>d</math> be Dick's present age. How many ordered pairs of positive integers <math>(d,n)</math> are possible?
