== Problem ==
Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence. 

* Harold starts with the first picket and paints every <math>h</math>th picket; 
* Tanya starts with the second picket and paints every <math>t</math>th picket; and 
* Ulysses starts with the third picket and paints every <math>u</math>th picket. 

Call the positive integer <math>100h+10t+u</math> paintable when the triple <math>(h,t,u)</math> of positive integers results in every picket being painted exactly once. Find the sum of all the paintable integers.
