Polyhedron <math>ABCDEFG</math> has six faces.  Face <math>ABCD</math> is a square with <math>AB = 12;</math> face <math>ABFG</math> is a trapezoid with <math>\overline{AB}</math> parallel to <math>\overline{GF},</math> <math>BF = AG = 8,</math> and <math>GF = 6;</math> and face <math>CDE</math> has <math>CE = DE = 14.</math>  The other three faces are <math>ADEG, BCEF,</math> and <math>EFG.</math>  The distance from <math>E</math> to face <math>ABCD</math> is 12.  Given that <math>EG^2 = p - q\sqrt {r},</math> where <math>p, q,</math> and <math>r</math> are positive integers and <math>r</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime, find <math>p + q + r.</math>
