== Solution 1 ==
There are 66 ways of picking two vertices. Note with any two vertices one can draw three squares (''two'' with the vertices forming a side, another with the vertices forming the diagonal). So so far we have <math>66(3)=198</math> squares, but we have overcounted since some squares have their other two vertices in the dodecagon as well. All 12 combinations of two distinct vertices that form a square side only form 3 squares, and all 12 combinations of two vertices that form a square diagonal only form 6 squares. So in total, we have overcounted by <math>9+6=15</math>, and <math>198-15=\fbox{183}</math>.
