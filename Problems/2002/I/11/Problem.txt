== Problem ==
Let <math>ABCD</math> and <math>BCFG</math> be two faces of a cube with <math>AB=12</math>. A beam of light emanates from vertex <math>A</math> and reflects off face <math>BCFG</math> at point <math>P</math>, which is 7 units from <math>\overline{BG}</math> and 5 units from <math>\overline{BC}</math>. The beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube. The length of the light path from the time it leaves point <math>A</math> until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is given by <math>m\sqrt{n}</math>, where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are integers and <math>n</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find <math>m+n</math>.
