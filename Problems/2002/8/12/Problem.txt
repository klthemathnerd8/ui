== Problem ==

A board game spinner is divided into three regions labeled $A$, $B$ and $C$. The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ and on region $B$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of the arrow stopping on region $C$ is:


$ \text{(A)}\ \frac{1}{12}\qquad\text{(B)}\ \frac{1}{6}\qquad\text{(C)}\ \frac{1}{5}\qquad\text{(D)}\ \frac{1}{3}\qquad\text{(E)}\ \frac{2}{5} $
