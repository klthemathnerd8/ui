==Solution 1==
Case 1: There are two heads and two tails. There are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose which two tosses are heads, and the other two must be tails.

Case 2: There are three heads, one tail. There are $\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways to choose which of the four tosses is a tail.

Case 3: There are four heads and no tails. This can only happen $1$ way.

There are a total of $2^4=16$ possible configurations, giving a probability of $\frac{6+4+1}{16} = \boxed{\text{(E)}\ \frac{11}{16}}$.
