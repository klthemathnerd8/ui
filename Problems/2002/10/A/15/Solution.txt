==Solution==
Since a multiple-digit prime number is not divisible by either 2 or 5, it must end with 1, 3, 7, or 9 in the units place. The remaining digits given must therefore appear in the tens place. Hence our answer is $20 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 9 = 190\Rightarrow\boxed{(E)= 190}$.

(Note that we did not need to actually construct the primes. If we had to, one way to match the tens and ones digits to form four primes is $23$, $41$, $59$, and $67$.)

(You could also guess the numbers, if you have a lot of spare time.)
