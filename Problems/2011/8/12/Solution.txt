==Solution 1==
If we designate a person to be on a certain side, then all placements of the other people can be considered unique. WLOG, assign Angie to be on the side. There are then $3!=6$ total seating arrangements. If Carlos is across from Angie, there are only $2!=2$ ways to fill the remaining two seats. Then the probability Angie and Carlos are seated opposite each other is $\frac26=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac13}$
