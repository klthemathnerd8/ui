The requested ratio is $$\dfrac{10^{10}}{10^9 + 10^8 + \ldots + 10 + 1}.$$ Using the formula for a geometric series, we have $$10^9 + 10^8 + \ldots + 10 + 1 = \dfrac{10^{10} - 1}{10 - 1} = \dfrac{10^{10} - 1}{9},$$ which is very close to $\dfrac{10^{10}}{9},$ so the ratio is very close to $\boxed{\mathrm{(B) \ } 9}.$
