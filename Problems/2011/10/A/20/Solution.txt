==Solution 1==

Fix a point $A$ from which we draw a clockwise chord. In order for the clockwise chord from another point $B$ to intersect that of point $A$, $A$ and $B$ must be no more than $r$ units apart. By drawing the circle, we quickly see that $B$ can be on $\frac{120}{360}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}  \ \textbf{(D)}}$ of the perimeter of the circle. (Imagine a regular hexagon inscribed in the circle)
