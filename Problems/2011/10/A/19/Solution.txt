Let the population of the town in $1991$ be $p^2$. Let the population in $2001$ be $q^2+9$. It follows that $p^2+150=q^2+9$. Rearrange this equation to get $141=q^2-p^2=(q-p)(q+p)$. Since $q$ and $p$ are both positive integers with $q>p$, $(q-p)$ and $(q+p)$ also must be, and thus, they are both factors of $141$. We have two choices for pairs of factors of $141$: $1$ and $141$, and $3$ and $47$. Assuming the former pair, since $(q-p)$ must be less than $(q+p)$, $q-p=1$ and $q+p=141$. Solve to get $p=70, q=71$. Since $p^2+300$ is not a perfect square, this is not the correct pair. Solve for the other pair to get $p=22, q=25$. This time, $p^2+300=22^2+300=784=28^2$. This is the correct pair. Now, we find the percent increase from $22^2=484$ to $28^2=784$. Since the increase is $300$, the percent increase is $\frac{300}{484}\times100\%\approx\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 62\%}$.
