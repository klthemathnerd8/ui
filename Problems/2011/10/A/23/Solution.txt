== Solution 1 ==
First look at the numbers Alice says. $1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 \cdots$ skipping every number that is congruent to $2 \pmod 3$. Thus, Barbara says those numbers EXCEPT every second - being $2 + 3^1 \equiv 5 \pmod{3^2=9}$. So Barbara skips every number congruent to $5 \pmod 9$. We continue and see: 

Alice skips $2 \pmod 3$, Barbara skips $5 \pmod 9$, Candice skips $14 \pmod {27}$, Debbie skips $41 \pmod {81}$, Eliza skips $122 \pmod {243}$, and Fatima skips $365 \pmod {729}$.

Since the only number congruent to $365 \pmod {729}$ and less than $1,000$ is $365$, the correct answer is $ \boxed{365\ \mathbf{(C)}} $.
