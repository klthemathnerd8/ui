== Solution 1 ==
First, we determine which possible combinations of digits <math>1</math> through <math>9</math> will yield sums that are multiples of <math>3</math>. It is simplest to do this by looking at each of the digits <math>\bmod{3}</math>.

We see that the numbers <math>1, 4,</math> and <math>7</math> are congruent to <math>1 \pmod{3}</math>, that the numbers <math>2, 5,</math> and <math>8</math> are congruent to <math>2 \pmod{3}</math>, and that the numbers <math>3, 6,</math> and <math>9</math> are congruent to <math>0 \pmod{3}</math>. In order for a sum of three of these numbers to be a multiple of three, the mod <math>3</math> sum must be congruent to <math>0</math>. Quick inspection reveals that the only possible combinations are <math>0+0+0, 1+1+1, 2+2+2,</math> and <math>0+1+2</math>. However, every set of three consecutive vertices must sum to a multiple of three, so using any of <math>0+0+0, 1+1+1</math>, or <math>2+2+2</math> would cause an adjacent sum to include exactly <math>2</math> digits with the same <math>\bmod{3}</math> value, and this is an unacceptable arrangement. Thus the only possible groupings are composed of three digits congruent to three different <math> \bmod{3} </math> values. 

We see also that there are two possible arrangements for these trios on the nonagon: a digit congruent to <math> 1 \pmod{3} </math> can be located counterclockwise of a digit congruent to <math> 0 </math> and clockwise of a digit congruent to <math> 2 \pmod{3} </math>, or the reverse can be true. 

We set the first digit as <math> 3 </math> avoid overcounting rotations, so we have one option as a choice for the first digit.  The other two <math> 0 \pmod{3} </math> numbers can be arranged in <math> 2!=2 </math> ways.  The three <math> 1 \pmod{3}</math> and three <math> 2 \pmod{3} </math> can both be arranged in <math>3!=6</math> ways.  Therefore, the desired result is <math> 2(2 \times 6 \times 6)=\boxed{144} </math>.
