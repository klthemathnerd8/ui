== Solution ==
Take the average of her current test scores, which is
$$ \frac{90+80+70+60+85}{5} = \frac{385}{5} = 77 $$

This means that she wants her test average after the sixth test to be $80.$ Let $x$ be the score that Josanna receives on her sixth test. Thus, our equation is

$$ \frac{90+80+70+60+85+x}{6} = 80 $$

$$ 385+x = 480 $$

$$ x = \boxed{95 \textbf{(E)}} $$
