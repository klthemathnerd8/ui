== Solution ==
The total amount of money that was spent during the trip was
$$ A + B $$
So each person should pay
$$ \frac{A+B}{2} $$
if they were to share the costs equally. Because LeRoy has already paid $A$ dollars of his part, he still has to pay
$$ \frac{A+B}{2} - A = $$
$$ = \boxed{\frac{B-A}{2} \textbf{(C)}} $$
