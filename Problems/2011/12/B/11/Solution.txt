== Solution ==
Since the frog always jumps in length $5$ and lands on a lattice point, the sum of its coordinates must change either by $5$ (by jumping parallel to the x- or y-axis), or by $3$ or $4$ (3-4-5 right triangle).

Because either $1$, $5$, or $7$ is always the change of the sum of the coordinates, the sum of the coordinates will always change from odd to even or vice versa. Thus, it can't go from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ in an even number of moves. Therefore, the frog cannot reach $(1,0)$ in two moves.  

However, a path is possible in 3 moves:  from $(0,0)$ to $(3,4)$ to $(6,0)$ to $(1,0)$.

Thus, the answer is  $ = \boxed{3 \textbf{}} $.
