== Solution ==
There are $18$ total twins and $18$ total triplets. Each of the twins shakes hands with the $16$ twins not in their family and $9$ of the triplets, a total of $25$ people. Each of the triplets shakes hands with the $15$ triplets not in their family and $9$ of the twins, for a total of $24$ people. Dividing by two to accommodate the fact that each handshake was counted twice, we get a total of $\frac{1}{2}\times 18 \times (25+24) = 9 \times 49 = 441 \rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{B}}$
