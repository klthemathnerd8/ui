== Solution 1==
We start with $ 2^{1+\lfloor\log_{2}(N-1)\rfloor}-N = 19$. After rearranging, we get $\lfloor\log_{2}(N-1)\rfloor = \log_{2} \left(\frac{N+19}{2}\right)$.

Since $ \lfloor\log_{2}(N-1)\rfloor $ is a positive integer, $ \frac{N+19}{2}$ must be in the form of $2^{m} $ for some positive integer $ m $. From this fact, we get $N=2^{m+1}-19$.

If we now check integer values of N that satisfy this condition, starting from $N=19$, we quickly see that the first values that work for $N$ are $45$ and $109$, that is, $2^6-19$ and $2^7 -19$, giving values of $5$ and $6$ for $m$, respectively. Adding up these two values for $N$, we get $45 + 109 = 154 \rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{C}}$
