Plugging in some values, we see that the  graph of the equation $|x+y|+|x-y| = 2$ is a square bounded by $x= \pm 1$ and $y = \pm 1$.

Notice that $x^2 - 6x + y^2 = (x-3)^2 + y^2 - 9$ means the square of the distance from a point $(x,y)$ to point $(3,0)$ minus 9. To maximize that value, we need to choose the point in the feasible region farthest from point $(3,0)$, which is $(-1, \pm 1)$. Either one, when substituting into the function, yields $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 8}$.
