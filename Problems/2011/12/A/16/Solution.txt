== Solution ==

We can do some casework when working our way around the pentagon from $A$ to $E$. At each stage, there will be a makeshift diagram.

1.) For $A$, we can choose any of the 6 colors.

         A : 6

2.) For $B$, we can either have the same color as $A$, or any of the other 5 colors. We do this because each vertex of the pentagon is affected by the 2 opposite vertices, and $D$ will be affected by both $A$ and $B$.

       A : 6
  B:1        B:5

3.) For $C$, we cannot have the same color as $A$. Also, we can have the same color as $B$ ($E$ will be affected), or any of the other 4 colors. Because $C$ can't be the same as $A$, it can't be the same as $B$ if $B$ is the same as $A$, so it can be any of the 5 other colors.

       A : 6
  B:1        B:5
  C:5     C:4   C:1

4.) $D$ is affected by $A$ and $B$. If they are the same, then $D$ can be any of the other 5 colors. If they are different, then $D$ can be any of the (6-2)=4 colors.

       A : 6
  B:1        B:5
  C:5     C:4   C:1
  D:5     D:4   D:4

5.) $E$ is affected by $B$ and $C$. If they are the same, then $E$ can be any of the other 5 colors. If they are different, then $E$ can be any of the (6-2)=4 colors.

       A : 6
  B:1        B:5
  C:5     C:4   C:1
  D:5     D:4   D:4
  E:4     E:4   E:5

6.) Now, we can multiply these three paths and add them:
$(6\times1\times5\times5\times4)+(6\times5\times4\times4\times4)+(6\times5\times1\times4\times5)
=600+1920+600=3120$

7.) Our answer is $C$!
