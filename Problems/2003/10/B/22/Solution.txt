First, find how many chimes will have already happened before midnight (the beginning of the day) of $\text{February 27, 2003}.$ $13$ half-hours have passed, and the number of chimes according to the hour is $1+2+3+\cdots+12.$ The total number of chimes is $13+78=91.$

Every day, there will be $24$ half-hours and $2(1+2+3+\cdots+12)$ chimes according to the arrow, resulting in $24+156=180$ total chimes.

On $\text{February 26},$ the number of chimes that still need to occur is $2003-91=1912.$ $1912 \div 180=10 \text{R}112.$ Rounding up, it is $11$ days past $\text{February 26},$ which is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) \ } \text{March 9}}$
