It is a well-known fact that the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is $n^2$.  This makes the sum of the first $8$ odd numbers equal to $64$.

Let $n$ be equal to the smallest of the $5$ even integers.  Then $(n+2)$ is the next highest, $(n+4)$ even higher, and so on.

This sets up the equation $n+(n+2)+(n+4)+(n+6)+(n+8)+4=64$

Now we solve:

$$5n+24=64$$
$$5n=40$$
$$n=8$$

Thus, the smallest integer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 8}$.
