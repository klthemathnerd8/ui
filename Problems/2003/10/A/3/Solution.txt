== Solution ==
The volume of the original box is $15\cdot10\cdot8=1200.$ 

The volume of each cube that is removed is $3\cdot3\cdot3=27.$

Since there are $8$ corners on the box, $8$ cubes are removed. 

So the total volume removed is $8\cdot27=216$. 

Therefore, the desired percentage is $\frac{216}{1200}\cdot100 = \boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ 18\%}.$
