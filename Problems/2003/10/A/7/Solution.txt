== Solution ==
By the [[triangle inequality]], no side may have a length greater than the semiperimeter, which is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot7=3.5$. 

Since all sides must be integers, the largest possible length of a side is $3$. Therefore, all such triangles must have all sides of length $1$, $2$, or $3$. Since $2+2+2=6<7$, at least one side must have a length of $3$. Thus, the remaining two sides have a combined length of $7-3=4$. So, the remaining sides must be either $3$ and $1$ or $2$ and $2$. Therefore, the number of triangles is $\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 2}$.
