==Solution 1==
Since she walked $1$ km to school and $1$ km back home, her total distance is $1+1=2$ km. 

Since she spent $30$ minutes walking to school and $10$ minutes walking back home, her total time is $30+10=40$ minutes = $\frac{40}{60}=\frac{2}{3}$ hours. 

Therefore her average speed in km/hr is $\frac{2}{\frac{2}{3}}=\boxed{\mathrm{(A)}\ 3}$.
