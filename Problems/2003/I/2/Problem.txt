== Problem ==
One hundred [[concentric]] [[circle]]s with [[radius | radii]] <math> 1, 2, 3, \dots, 100 </math> are drawn in a plane. The interior of the circle of radius <math>1</math> is colored red, and each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color. The [[ratio]] of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius <math>100</math> can be expressed as <math> m/n, </math> where <math> m </math> and <math> n </math> are [[relatively prime]] [[positive integer]]s. Find <math> m + n. </math>
