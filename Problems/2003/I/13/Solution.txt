== Solution 1 ==
In base-<math>2</math> representation, all positive numbers have a leftmost digit of <math>1</math>. Thus there are <math>{n \choose k}</math> numbers that have <math>n+1</math> digits in base <math>2</math> notation, with <math>k+1</math> of the digits being <math>1</math>'s. 

In order for there to be more <math>1</math>'s than <math>0</math>'s, we must have <math>k+1 > \frac{n+1}{2} \implies k > \frac{n-1}{2} \implies k \ge \frac{n}{2}</math>. Therefore, the number of such numbers corresponds to the sum of all numbers on or to the right of the vertical line of symmetry in [[Pascal's Triangle]], from rows <math>0</math> to <math>10</math> (as <math>2003 < 2^{11}-1</math>). Since the sum of the elements of the <math>r</math>th row is <math>2^r</math>, it follows that the sum of all elements in rows <math>0</math> through <math>10</math> is <math>2^0 + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^{10} = 2^{11}-1 = 2047</math>. The center elements are in the form <math>{2i \choose i}</math>, so the sum of these elements is <math>\sum_{i=0}^{5} {2i \choose i} = 1 + 2 +6 + 20 + 70 + 252 = 351</math>.

The sum of the elements on or to the right of the line of symmetry is thus <math>\frac{2047 + 351}{2} = 1199</math>. However, we also counted the <math>44</math> numbers from <math>2004</math> to <math>2^{11}-1 = 2047</math>. Indeed, all of these numbers have at least <math>6</math> <math>1</math>'s in their base-<math>2</math> representation, as all of them are greater than <math>1984 = 11111000000_2</math>, which has <math>5</math> <math>1</math>'s. Therefore, our answer is <math>1199 - 44 = 1155</math>, and the remainder is <math>\boxed{155}</math>.
