For every $60$ minutes that pass by in actual time, $57+\frac{36}{60}=57.6$ minutes pass by on Cassandra's watch. When her watch first reads, 10:00 pm, $10(60)=600$ minutes have passed by on her watch. Setting up a proportion,

$$\frac{57.6}{60}=\frac{600}{x}$$

where $x$ is the number of minutes that have passed by in actual time. Solve for $x$ to get $625$ minutes, or $10$ hours and $25$ minutes $\Rightarrow \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \text{10:25 PM}}$.
