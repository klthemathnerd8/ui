==Problem==

Penniless Pete's piggy bank has no pennies in it, but it has 100 coins, all nickels,dimes, and quarters, whose total value is &#036;8.35. It does not necessarily contain coins of all three types. What is the difference between the largest and smallest number of dimes that could be in the bank?
