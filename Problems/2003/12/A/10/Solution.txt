Because the ratios are $3:2:1$, Al, Bert, and Carl believe that they need to take $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/6$ of the pile when they each arrive, respectively. After each person comes, $1/2$, $2/3$, and $5/6$ of the pile's size (just before each came) remains. The pile starts at $1$, and at the end $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{5}{6}\cdot 1 = \frac{5}{18}$ of the original pile goes unclaimed. (Note that because of the properties of multiplication, it does not matter what order the three come in.) Hence the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(D)}\ \dfrac{5}{18}}$.
