Let the squares be labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.

When the polygon is folded, the "right" edge of square $A$ becomes adjacent to the "bottom edge" of square $C$, and the "bottom" edge of square $A$ becomes adjacent to the "bottom" edge of square $D$. 

So, any "new" square that is attatched to those edges will prevent the polygon from becoming a cube with one face missing. 

Therefore, squares $1$, $2$, and $3$ will prevent the polygon from becoming a cube with one face missing.

Squares  $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, and $9$ will allow the polygon to become a cube with one face missing when folded. 

Thus the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 6}$.

===Solution 2===
Another way to think of it is that a cube missing one face has $5$ of its $6$ faces.  Since the shape has $4$ faces already, we need another face.  The only way to add another face is if the added square does not overlap any of the others.  $1$,$2$, and $3$ overlap, while squares $4$ to $9$ do not. The answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 6}$

===Solution 3===
If you're good at visualizing, you can imagine each box and fold up the shape into a 3D shape. This solution is only recommended if you are either in a hurry or extremely skilled at visualizing. We find out that $4,5,6,7,8$ and $9$ work. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(E)}\ 6}$. ~Sophia866
