=== Solution 1 ===
Let the roots be $r_1=0, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5$. According to [[Vieta's formulas | Vi√®te's formulae]], we have $d=r_1r_2r_3r_4 + r_1r_2r_3r_5 + r_1r_2r_4r_5 + r_1r_3r_4r_5 + r_2r_3r_4r_5$. The first four terms contain $r_1=0$ and are therefore zero, thus $d=r_2r_3r_4r_5$. This is a product of four non-zero numbers, therefore $d$ must be non-zero $\Longrightarrow \mathrm{(D)}$.

=== Solution 2 ===
Clearly, since $(0,0)$ is an intercept, $e$ must be $0$. But if $d$ was $0$, $x^2$ would divide the polynomial, which means it would have a double root at $0$, which is impossible, since all five roots are distinct.
