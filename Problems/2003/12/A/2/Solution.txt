== Solution ==
Since T-shirts cost $5$ dollars more than a pair of socks, T-shirts cost $5+4=9$ dollars. 

Since each member needs $2$ pairs of socks and $2$ T-shirts, the total cost for $1$ member is $2(4+9)=26$ dollars. 

Since $2366$ dollars was the cost for the club, and $26$ was the cost per member, the number of members in the League is $2366\div 26=\boxed{\mathrm{(B)}\ 91}$.
