== Problem ==
Business is a little slow at Lou's Fine Shoes, so Lou decides to have a
sale. On Friday, Lou increases all of Thursday's prices by $ 10 $ percent. Over the
weekend, Lou advertises the sale: "Ten percent off the listed price. Sale
starts Monday." How much does a pair of shoes cost on Monday that
cost $ 40 $ dollars on Thursday?

$ \textbf{(A)}\ 36\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 39.60\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 40\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 40.40\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 44 $
