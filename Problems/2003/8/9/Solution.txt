The area of one of Art's cookies is $ 3 \cdot 3 + \frac{2 \cdot 3}{2}=9+3=12 $. As he has $ 12 $ cookies in a batch, the amount of dough each person used is $ 12 \cdot 12=144 $. Roger's cookies have an area of $ \frac{144}{2 \cdot 4}=\frac{144}{8}= 18 $ cookies in  a batch. In total, the amount of money Art will earn is $ 12 \cdot 60=720 $. Thus, the amount Roger would need to charge per cookie is $ \frac{720}{18}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 40}$.
