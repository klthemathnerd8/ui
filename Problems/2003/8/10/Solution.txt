== Solution ==
Art's cookies have areas of $ 3 \cdot 3 + \frac{2 \cdot 3}{2}=9+3=12 $. There are 12 cookies in one of Art's batches so everyone used $ 12 \cdot 12=144 \text{ in}^2 $ of dough. Trisha's cookies have an area of $ \frac{3 \cdot 4}{2}=6 $ so she has $ \frac{144}{6}=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 24}$ cookies per batch.
