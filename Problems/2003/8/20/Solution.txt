==Solution 1==

Imagine the clock as a circle. The minute hand will be at the 4 at 20 minutes past the  hour. The central angle formed between $4$ and $5$ is $30$ degrees (since it is 1/12 of a full circle, 360). By $4:20$, the hour hand would have moved $\frac{1}{3}$ way from 4 to 5 since $\frac{20}{60}$ is reducible to $\frac{1}{3}$. One third of the way from 4 to 5 is one third of 30 degrees, which is 10 degrees past the 4. Recall that the minute hand is at the 4, so the angle between them is $\boxed{(D)  10}$.
