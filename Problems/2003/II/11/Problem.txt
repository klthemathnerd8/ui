== Problem ==
Triangle <math>ABC</math> is a right triangle with <math>AC = 7,</math> <math>BC = 24,</math> and right angle at <math>C.</math> Point <math>M</math> is the midpoint of <math>AB,</math> and <math>D</math> is on the same side of line <math>AB</math> as <math>C</math> so that <math>AD = BD = 15.</math> Given that the area of triangle <math>CDM</math> may be expressed as <math>\frac {m\sqrt {n}}{p},</math> where <math>m,</math> <math>n,</math> and <math>p</math> are positive integers, <math>m</math> and <math>p</math> are relatively prime, and <math>n</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime, find <math>m + n + p.</math>
