== Solution ==
Call the two integers <math>b</math> and <math>b+60</math>, so we have <math>\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{b+60}=\sqrt{c}</math>. Square both sides to get <math>2b+60+2\sqrt{b^2+60b}=c</math>. Thus, <math>b^2+60b</math> must be a square, so we have <math>b^2+60b=n^2</math>, and <math>(b+n+30)(b-n+30)=900</math>. The sum of these two factors is <math>2b+60</math>, so they must both be even. To maximize <math>b</math>, we want to maximixe <math>b+n+30</math>, so we let it equal <math>450</math> and the other factor <math>2</math>, but solving gives <math>b=196</math>, which is already a perfect square, so we have to keep going. In order to keep both factors even, we let the larger one equal <math>150</math> and the other <math>6</math>, which gives <math>b=48</math>. This checks, so the solution is <math>48+108=\boxed{156}</math>.
