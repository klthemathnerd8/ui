==Solution 1==
One could recursively compute the probabilities of reaching <math>(0,0)</math> as the first axes point from any point <math>(x,y)</math> as <cmath>P(x,y) = \frac{1}{3} P(x-1,y) + \frac{1}{3} P(x,y-1) + \frac{1}{3} P(x-1,y-1)</cmath> for <math>x,y \geq 1,</math> and the base cases are
<math>P(0,0) = 1, P(x,0) = P(y,0) = 0</math> for any <math>x,y</math> not equal to zero.
We then recursively find <math>P(4,4) = \frac{245}{2187}</math> so the answer is <math>245 + 7 = \boxed{252}</math>.



If this algebra seems intimidating, you can watch a nice pictorial explanation of this by On The Spot Stem.
