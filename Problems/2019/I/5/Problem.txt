==Problem==
A moving particle starts at the point <math>(4,4)</math> and moves until it hits one of the coordinate axes for the first time. When the particle is at the point <math>(a,b)</math>, it moves at random to one of the points <math>(a-1,b)</math>, <math>(a,b-1)</math>, or <math>(a-1,b-1)</math>, each with probability <math>\frac{1}{3}</math>, independently of its previous moves. The probability that it will hit the coordinate axes at <math>(0,0)</math> is <math>\frac{m}{3^n}</math>, where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are positive integers such that <math>m</math> is not divisible by <math>3</math>. Find <math>m + n</math>.
