==Problem==
A soccer team has <math>22</math> available players. A fixed set of <math>11</math> players starts the game, while the other <math>11</math> are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as <math>3</math> substitutions, where any one of the <math>11</math> players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let <math>n</math> be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when <math>n</math> is divided by <math>1000</math>.
