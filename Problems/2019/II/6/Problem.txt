==Problem==
In a Martian civilization, all logarithms whose bases are not specified are assumed to be base <math>b</math>, for some fixed <math>b\ge2</math>. A Martian student writes down
<cmath>3\log(\sqrt{x}\log x)=56</cmath>
<cmath>\log_{\log x}(x)=54</cmath>
and finds that this system of equations has a single real number solution <math>x>1</math>. Find <math>b</math>.
