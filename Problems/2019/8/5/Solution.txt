==Solution 1 - Using the answers==
First, the tortoise walks at a constant rate, ruling out $(D)$
Second, when the hare is resting, the distance will stay the same, ruling out $(E)$ and $(C)$.
Third, the tortoise wins the race, meaning that the non-constant one should go off the graph last, ruling out $(A)$.
Therefore, the answer $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$ is the only one left.
