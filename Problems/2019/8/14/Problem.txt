==Problem 14==
Isabella has $6$ coupons that can be redeemed for free ice cream cones at Pete's Sweet Treats. In order to make the coupons last, she decides that she will redeem one every $10$ days until she has used them all. She knows that Pete's is closed on Sundays, but as she circles the $6$ dates on her calendar, she realizes that no circled date falls on a Sunday.  On what day of the week does Isabella redeem her first coupon?

$\textbf{(A) }\text{Monday}\qquad\textbf{(B) }\text{Tuesday}\qquad\textbf{(C) }\text{Wednesday}\qquad\textbf{(D) }\text{Thursday}\qquad\textbf{(E) }\text{Friday}$
