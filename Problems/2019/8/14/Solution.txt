==Solution 1==
Let $\text{Day
}1$ to $\text{Day\\ }2$ denote a day where one coupon is redeemed and the day when the second coupon is redeemed. 

If she starts on a $\text{Monday}$, she redeems her next coupon on $\text{Thursday}$. 

$\text{Thursday}$ to $\text{Sunday}$.

Thus, $\textbf{(A)}\ \text{Monday}$ is incorrect.


If she starts on a $\text{Tuesday}$, she redeems her next coupon on $\text{Friday}$.

$\text{Friday}$ to $\text{Monday}$.

$\text{Monday}$ to $\text{Thursday}$.

$\text{Thursday}$ to $\text{Sunday}$.

Thus $\textbf{(B)}\ \text{Tuesday}$ is incorrect.


If she starts on a $\text{Wednesday}$, she redeems her next coupon on $\text{Saturday}$.

$\text{Saturday}$ to $\text{Tuesday}$.

$\text{Tuesday}$ to $\text{Friday}$.

$\text{Friday}$ to $\text{Monday}$.

$\text{Monday}$ to $\text{Thursday}$.

And on $\text{Thursday}$, she redeems her last coupon. 


No Sunday occured; thus, $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \text{Wednesday}}$ is correct. 


Checking for the other options, 


If she starts on a $\text{Thursday}$, she redeems her next coupon on $\text{Sunday}$.

Thus, $\textbf{(D)}\ \text{Thursday}$ is incorrect.


If she starts on a $\text{Friday}$, she redeems her next coupon on $\text{Monday}$.

$\text{Monday}$ to $\text{Thursday}$.

$\text{Thursday}$ to $\text{Sunday}$.


Checking for the other options gave us negative results; thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \text{Wednesday}}$.
