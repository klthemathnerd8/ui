==Solution 1==

First of all, $d$ obviously has to be smaller than $M$, since when calculating $M$, we must take into account the $29$s, $30$s, and $31$s. So we can eliminate choices $B$ and $C$. Since there are $365$ total entries, the median, $M$, must be the $183\text{rd}$ one, at which point we note that $12 \cdot 15$ is $180$, so $16$ has to be the median (because $183$ is between $12 \cdot 15 + 1 = 181$ and $12 \cdot 16 = 192$). Now, the mean, $\mu$, must be smaller than $16$, since there are many fewer $29$s, $30$s, and $31$s. $d$ is less than $\mu$, because when calculating $\mu$, we would include $29$, $30$, and $31$. Thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } d < \mu < M}$.
