==Solution 1==

The $5$ and $7$ can be painted with no restrictions because the set of integers does not contain a multiple or proper factor of $5$ or $7$. There are 3 ways to paint each, giving us $\underline{9}$ ways to paint both. The $2$ is the most restrictive number. There are $\underline{3}$ ways to paint $2$, but without loss of generality, let it be painted red. $4$ cannot be the same color as $2$ or $8$, so there are $\underline{2}$ ways to paint $4$, which automatically determines the color for $8$. $6$ cannot be painted red, so there are $\underline{2}$ ways to paint $6$, but WLOG, let it be painted blue. There are $\underline{2}$ choices for the color for $3$, which is either red or green in this case. Lastly, there are $\underline{2}$ ways to choose the color for $9$.

$9 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = \boxed{\textbf{(E) }432}$.
