The polynomial can be factored further broken down into

$P(x) = (x - [1 - i])(x - [1 + i])(x - [2 - 2i])(x - [2 + 2i])(x^2 - cx + 4)$

by using the [[quadratic formula]] on each of the quadratic factors. Since the first four roots are all distinct, the term $(x^2 - cx + 4)$ must be a product of any combination of two (not necessarily distinct) factors from the set: $(x - [1 - i]), (x - [1 + i]), (x - [2 - 2i]),$ and $(x - [2 + 2i])$. We need the two factors to yield a constant term of $4$ when multiplied together. The only combinations that work are $(x - [1 - i])$ and $(x - [2 + 2i])$, or $(x - [1+i])$ and $(x - [2-2i])$. When multiplied together, the polynomial is either $(x^2 + [-3 + i]x + 4)$ or $(x^2+[-3-i]x+4)$. Therefore, $c = 3 \pm i$ and $|c| = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } \sqrt{10}}$.
