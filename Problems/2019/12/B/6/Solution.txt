==Solution 1==

Notice that whatever point we pick for $C$, $AB$ will be the base of the triangle. Without loss of generality, let points $A$ and $B$ be $(0,0)$ and $(10,0)$, since for any other combination of points, we can just rotate the plane to make them $(0,0)$ and $(10,0)$ under a new coordinate system. When we pick point $C$, we have to make sure that its $y$-coordinate is $\pm20$, because that's the only way the area of the triangle can be $100$. 

Now when the perimeter is minimized, by symmetry, we put $C$ in the middle, at $(5, 20)$. We can easily see that $AC$ and $BC$ will both be $\sqrt{20^2+5^2} = \sqrt{425}$. The perimeter of this minimal triangle is $2\sqrt{425} + 10$, which is larger than $50$. Since the minimum perimeter is greater than $50$, there is no triangle that satisfies the condition, giving us $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0}$.
