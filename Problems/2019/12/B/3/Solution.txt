We can simply graph the points, or use coordinate geometry, to realize that both $A'$ and $B'$ are, respectively, obtained by rotating $A$ and $B$ by $180^{\circ}$ about the origin. Hence the rotation by $180^{\circ}$ about the origin maps the line segment $\overline{AB}$ to the line segment $\overline{A'B'}$, so the answer is $\boxed{(\text{E})}$.
