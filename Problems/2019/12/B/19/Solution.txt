==Solution 1==
On the first turn, each player starts off with $\$1$. Each turn after that, there are only two possibilities: either everyone stays at $\$1$, which we will write as $(1-1-1)$, or the distribution of money becomes $\$2-\$1-\$0$ in some order, which we write as $(2-1-0)$. ($(3-0-0)$ cannot be achieved since either(1)the person cannot give money to himself or (2)there are a maximum of 2 dollars being distributed and the person has nothing to start with). We will consider these two states separately.

In the $(1-1-1)$ state, each person has two choices for whom to give their dollar to, meaning there are $2^3=8$ possible ways that the money can be rearranged. Note that there are only two ways that we can reach $(1-1-1)$ again: 

1. Raashan gives his money to Sylvia, who gives her money to Ted, who gives his money to Raashan.

2. Raashan gives his money to Ted, who gives his money to Sylvia, who gives her money to Raashan.

Thus, the probability of staying in the $(1-1-1)$ state is $\frac{1}{4}$, while the probability of going to the $(2-1-0)$ state is $\frac{3}{4}$ (we can check that the 6 other possibilities lead to $(2-1-0)$)


In the $(2-1-0)$ state, we will label the person with $\$2$ as person A, the person with $\$1$ as person B, and the person with $\$0$ as person C. Person A has two options for whom to give money to, and person B has 2 options for whom to give money to, meaning there are total $2\cdot 2 = 4$ ways the money can be redistributed. The only way that the distribution can return to $(1-1-1)$ is if A gives $\$1$ to B, and B gives $\$1$ to C. We check the other possibilities to find that they all lead back to $(2-1-0)$. Thus, the probability of going to the $(1-1-1)$ state is $\frac{1}{4}$, while the probability of staying in the $(2-1-0)$ state is $\frac{3}{4}$.

No matter which state we are in, the probability of going to the $(1-1-1)$ state is always $\frac{1}{4}$. This means that, after the bell rings 2018 times, regardless of what state the money distribution is in, there is a $\frac{1}{4}$ probability of going to the $(1-1-1)$ state after the 2019th bell ring. Thus, our answer is simply $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{4}}$.
