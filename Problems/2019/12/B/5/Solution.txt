==Solution 1==

If he has enough money to buy $12$ pieces of red candy, $14$ pieces of green candy, and $15$ pieces of blue candy, then the smallest amount of money he could have is $\text{lcm}{(12,14,15)} = 420$ cents. Since a piece of purple candy costs $20$ cents, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\frac{420}{20} = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }  21}$.
