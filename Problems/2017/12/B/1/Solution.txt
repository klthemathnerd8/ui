Kymbrea has $30$ comic books initially and every month, she adds two. This can be represented as $30 + 2x$ where x is the number of months elapsed. LaShawn's collection, similarly, is $10 + 6x$. To find when LaShawn will have twice the number of comic books as Kymbrea, we solve for x with the equation $2(2x + 30) = 6x + 10$ and get $x = \boxed{\textbf{(E) } 25}$.
