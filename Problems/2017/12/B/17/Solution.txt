==Solution==
The probability of winning Game A is the sum of the probabilities of getting three tails and getting three heads which is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{27} + \frac{1}{27} = \frac{9}{27} = \frac{27}{81}$. The probability of winning Game B is the sum of the probabilities of getting two heads and getting two tails squared. This gives us $\left(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 \right)^2 = \left(\frac{5}{9}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{81}$. The probability of winning Game A is $\frac{27}{81}$ and the probability of winning Game B is $\frac{25}{81}$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$
