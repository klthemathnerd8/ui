==Solution 1==

The top cone has radius 2 and height 4 so it has volume $ \dfrac{1}{3} \pi (2)^2 \times 4 $. 

The frustum is made up by taking away a small cone of radius 1, height 4 from a large cone of radius 2, height 8, so it has volume
$ \dfrac{1}{3} \pi (2)^2 \times 8 - \dfrac{1}{3} \pi (1)^2 \times 4$.

Adding, we get $\dfrac{1}{3} \pi (16+32-4) = \boxed{ \textbf{E} \ \dfrac{44\pi}{3}}$.
