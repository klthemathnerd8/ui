Let total distance be $x$. Her speed in miles per minute is $\tfrac{x}{180}$. Then, the distance that she drove before hitting the snowstorm is $\tfrac{x}{3}$. Her speed in snowstorm is reduced $20$ miles per hour, or $\tfrac{1}{3}$ miles per minute. Knowing it took her $276$ minutes in total, we create equation: 
$$\text{Time before Storm}\, + \, \text{Time after Storm} = \text{Total Time} \Longrightarrow$$
$$\frac{\text{Distance before Storm}}{\text{Speed before Storm}} + \frac{\text{Distance in Storm}}{\text{Speed in Storm}} = \text{Total Time} \Longrightarrow \frac{\tfrac{x}{3}}{\tfrac{x}{180}} + \frac{\tfrac{2x}{3}}{\tfrac{x}{180} - \tfrac{1}{3}} = 276$$

Solving equation, we get $x=135$ $\Longrightarrow \boxed{B}$.
