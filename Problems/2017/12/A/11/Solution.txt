==Solution 1==

We know that the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is a multiple of $180$. Note that $\left\lceil\frac{2017}{180}\right\rceil = 12$ and $180\cdot 12 = 2160$, so the angle Claire forgot is $\equiv 2160-2017=143\mod 180$. Since the polygon is convex, the angle is $\leq 180$, so the answer is $\boxed{(D)\ =\ 143}$.
