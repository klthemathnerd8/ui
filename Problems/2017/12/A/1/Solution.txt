We can take two 5-popsicle boxes and one 3-popsicle box with $\$8$. Note that it is optimal since one popsicle is at the rate of $\$1$ per popsicle, three popsicles at $\$\frac{2}{3}$ per popsicle and finally, five popsicles at $\$\frac{3}{5}$ per popsicle, hence we want as many $\$3$ sets as possible. It is clear that the above is the optimal method. $\boxed{\textbf{D}}$.
