==Solution 1==
We start with the last two terms of the polynomial <math>1+n+\frac{n^2}{2!}+\frac{n^3}{3!}+\frac{n^4}{4!}+\frac{n^5}{5!}+\frac{n^6}{6!}</math>, which are <math>\frac{n^5}{5!}+\frac{n^6}{6!}</math>. This can simplify to <math>\frac{6n^5+n^6}{720}</math>, which can further simplify to <math>\frac{n^5(6+n)}{720}</math>. Notice that the prime factorization of <math>720</math> is <math>5\cdot3\cdot3\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2</math>. In order for <math>\frac{n^5(6+n)}{720}</math> to be an integer, one of the parts must divide <math>5, 3</math>, and <math>2</math>. Thus, one of the parts must be a multiple of <math>5, 3</math>, and <math>2</math>, and the LCM  of these three numbers is <math>30</math>. This means <cmath>n^5 \equiv 0\pmod{30}</cmath> or <cmath>6+n \equiv 0\pmod{30}</cmath> Thus, we can see that <math>n</math> must equal <math>0\pmod{30}</math> or <math>-6\pmod{30}</math>. Note that as long as we satisfy <math>\frac{6n^5+n^6}{720}</math>, <math>2!, 3!</math>, and <math>4!</math> will all divide into integers, as their prime factorizations will be fulfilled with the LCM being 30. E.g. <math>4! = 2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot3</math>, and this will be divisible by <math>2^4\cdot3^4\cdot5^4</math>. Now, since we know that <math>n</math> must equal <math>0\pmod{30}</math> or <math>-6\pmod{30}</math> in order for the polynomial to be an integer, <math>n\equiv0, 24\pmod{30}</math>. To find how many integers fulfill the equation and are <math><2017</math>, we take <math>\left \lfloor\frac{2017}{30} \right \rfloor</math> and multiply it by <math>2</math>. Thus, we get <math>67\cdot2=\boxed{134}</math>.
