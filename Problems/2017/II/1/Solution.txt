==Solution 1==
The number of subsets of a set with <math>n</math> elements is <math>2^n</math>. The total number of subsets of <math>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</math> is equal to <math>2^8</math>. The number of sets that are subsets of at least one of <math>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</math> or <math>\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</math> can be found using complementary counting. There are <math>2^5</math> subsets of <math>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</math> and <math>2^5</math> subsets of <math>\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</math>. It is easy to make the mistake of assuming there are <math>2^5+2^5</math> sets that are subsets of at least one of <math>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</math> or <math>\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</math>, but the <math>2^2</math> subsets of <math>\{4, 5\}</math> are overcounted. There are <math>2^5+2^5-2^2</math> sets that are subsets of at least one of <math>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</math> or <math>\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</math>, so there are <math>2^8-(2^5+2^5-2^2)</math> subsets of <math>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</math> that are subsets of neither <math>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</math> nor <math>\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</math>. <math>2^8-(2^5+2^5-2^2)=\boxed{196}</math>.
