==Problem==
The teams <math>T_1</math>, <math>T_2</math>, <math>T_3</math>, and <math>T_4</math> are in the playoffs. In the semifinal matches, <math>T_1</math> plays <math>T_4</math>, and <math>T_2</math> plays <math>T_3</math>. The winners of those two matches will play each other in the final match to determine the champion. When <math>T_i</math> plays <math>T_j</math>, the probability that <math>T_i</math> wins is <math>\frac{i}{i+j}</math>, and the outcomes of all the matches are independent. The probability that <math>T_4</math> will be the champion is <math>\frac{p}{q}</math>, where <math>p</math> and <math>q</math> are relatively prime positive integers. Find <math>p+q</math>.
