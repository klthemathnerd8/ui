==Solution==

If Sofia ran the first $100$ meters of each lap at $4$ meters per second and the remaining $300$ meters of each lap at $5$ meters per second, then she took $\frac{100}{4}+\frac{300}{5}=25+60=85$ seconds for each lap. Because she ran $5$ laps, she took a total of $5 \cdot 85=425$ seconds, or $7$ minutes and $5$ seconds. The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \text{7 minutes and 5 seconds}}$.
