==Solution 1==

Case 1: monotonous numbers with digits in ascending order

There are $\sum_{n=1}^{9} \binom{9}{n}$ ways to choose n digits from the digits 1 to 9. For each of these ways, we can generate exactly one monotonous number by ordering the chosen digits in ascending order. Note that 0 is not included since it will always be a leading digit and that is not allowed. Also, $\emptyset$ (the empty set) isn't included because it doesn't generate a number. The sum is equivalent to $\sum_{n=0}^{9} \binom{9}{n} -\binom{9}{0} = 2^9 - 1 = 511.$

Case 2: monotonous numbers with digits in descending order

There are $\sum_{n=1}^{10} \binom{10}{n}$ ways to choose n digits from the digits 0 to 9. For each of these ways, we can generate exactly one monotonous number by ordering the chosen digits in descending order. Note that 0 is included since we are allowed to end numbers with zeros. However, $\emptyset$ (the empty set) still isn't included because it doesn't generate a number. The sum is equivalent to $\sum_{n=0}^{10} \binom{10}{n} -\binom{10}{0} = 2^{10} - 1 = 1023.$ We discard the number 0 since it is not positive. Thus there are $1022$ here. 

Since the 1-digit numbers 1 to 9 satisfy both case 1 and case 2, we have overcounted by 9. Thus there are $511+1022-9=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }  1524}$ monotonous numbers.
