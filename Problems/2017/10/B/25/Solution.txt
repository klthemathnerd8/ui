Let the sum of the scores of Isabella's first $6$ tests be $S$. Since the mean of her first $7$ scores is an integer, then $S + 95 \equiv 0 \text{ (mod 7)}$, or  $S \equiv3 \text{ (mod 7)}$. Also, $S \equiv 0 \text{ (mod 6)}$, so by the [[CRT]], $S \equiv 24 \text{ (mod 42)}$. We also know that $91 \cdot 6 \leq S \leq 100 \cdot 6$, so by inspection, $S = 570$. However, we also have that the mean of the first $5$ test scores must be an integer, so the sum of the first $5$ test scores must be an multiple of $5$, which implies that the $6$th test score is $\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 100}$.
