==Solution 1==
We can solve this by finding all the combinations, then subtracting the ones that are on the same line. There are $25$ points in all, from $(1,1)$ to $(5,5)$, so $\dbinom{25}3$ is $\frac{25\cdot 24\cdot 23}{3\cdot 2 \cdot 1}$, which simplifies to $2300$.
Now we count the ones that are on the same line. We see that any three points chosen from $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$ would be on the same line, so $\dbinom53$ is $10$, and there are $5$ rows, $5$ columns, and $2$ long diagonals, so that results in $120$.
We can also count the ones with $4$ on a diagonal. That is $\dbinom43$, which is 4, and there are $4$ of those diagonals, so that results in $16$.
We can count the ones with only $3$ on a diagonal, and there are $4$ diagonals like that, so that results in $4$.
We can also count the ones with a slope of $\frac12$, $2$, $-\frac12$, or $-2$, with $3$ points in each. Note that there are $3$ such lines, for each slope, present in the grid. In total, this results in $12$.
Finally, we subtract all the ones in a line from $2300$, so we have $2300-120-16-4-12=\boxed{(\textbf{B})\ 2148}$
