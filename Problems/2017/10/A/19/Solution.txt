==Solution 1: Casework==

Let Alice be A, Bob be B, Carla be C, Derek be D, and Eric be E.
We can split this problem up into two cases:

$\textbf{Case 1: }$ A sits on an edge seat.

Since B and C can't sit next to A, that must mean either D or E sits next to A. After we pick either D or E, then either B or C must sit next to D/E. Then, we can arrange the two remaining people in two ways. Since there are two different edge seats that A can sit in, there are a total of $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 16$.

$\textbf{Case 2: }$ A does not sit in an edge seat.

Still, the only two people that can sit next to A are either D or E, and there are two ways to permute them, and this also handles the restriction that D can't sit next to E. Then, there are two ways to arrange B and C, the remaining people. However, there are three initial seats that A can sit in, so there are $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 12$ seatings in this case.

Adding up all the seatings, we have $16+12 = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 28}$.
