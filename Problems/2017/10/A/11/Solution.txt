==Solution 1==

In order to solve this problem, we must first visualize what the region looks like. We know that, in a three dimensional space, the region consisting of all points within $3$ units of a point would be a sphere with radius $3$.  However, we need to find the region containing all points within $3$ units of a segment.  It can be seen that our region is a cylinder with two hemispheres/endcaps on either end.  We know the volume of our region, so we set up the following equation (the volume of our cylinder + the volume of our two hemispheres will equal $216 \pi$):

$\frac{4 \pi }{3} \cdot 3^3+9 \pi x=216 \pi$, where $x$ is equal to the length of our line segment.

Solving, we find that $x = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20}$.
