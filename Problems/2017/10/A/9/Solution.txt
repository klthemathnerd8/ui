==Solution==
The distance from town $A$ to town $B$ is $10$ km uphill, and since Minnie rides uphill at a speed of $5$ kph, it will take her $2$ hours. Next, she will ride from town $B$ to town $C$, a distance of $15$ km all downhill. Since Minnie rides downhill at a speed of $30$ kph, it will take her half an hour. Finally, she rides from town $C$ back to town $A$, a flat distance of $20$ km. Minnie rides on a flat road at $20$ kph, so this will take her $1$ hour. Her entire trip takes her $3.5$ hours.
Secondly, Penny will go from town $A$ to town $C$, a flat distance of $20$ km. Since Penny rides on a flat road at $30$ kph, it will take her $\frac{2}{3}$ of an hour. Next Penny will go from town $C$ to town $B$, which is uphill for Penny. Since Penny rides at a speed of $10$ kph uphill, and town $C$ and $B$ are $15$ km apart, it will take her $1.5$ hours. Finally, Penny goes from Town $B$ back to town $A$, a distance of $10$ km downhill. Since Penny rides downhill at $40$ kph, it will only take her $\frac{1}{4}$ of an hour. In total, it takes her $29/12$ hours, which simplifies to $2$ hours and $25$ minutes.
Finally, Penny's $2$hr $25$min trip was $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 65}$ minutes less than Minnie's $3$hr $30$min trip.
