Notice this is the term $a_6$ in a recursive sequence, defined recursively as $a_1 = 3, a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 1.$ Thus:
$$\begin{split}
a_2 = 3 \cdot 2 + 1 = 7.\\
a_3 = 7 \cdot 2 + 1 = 15.\\
a_4 = 15 \cdot 2 + 1 = 31.\\
a_5 = 31 \cdot 2 + 1 = 63.\\
a_6 = 63 \cdot 2 + 1 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 127}
\end{split}$$
