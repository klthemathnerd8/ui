==Problem 6==
A circle is circumscribed around an isosceles triangle whose two congruent angles have degree measure <math>x</math>. Two points are chosen independently and uniformly at random on the circle, and a chord is drawn between them. The probability that the chord intersects the triangle is <math>\frac{14}{25}</math>. Find the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of <math>x</math>.
