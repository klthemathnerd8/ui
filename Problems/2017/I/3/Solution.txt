==Solution==
We see that <math>d_n</math> appears in cycles of <math>20</math> and the cycles are <cmath>1,3,6,0,5,1,8,6,5,5,6,8,1,5,0,6,3,1,0,0,</cmath> adding a total of <math>70</math> each cycle.
Since <math>\left\lfloor\frac{2017}{20}\right\rfloor=100</math>, we know that by <math>2017</math>, there have been <math>100</math> cycles and <math>7000</math> has been added. This can be discarded as we're just looking for the last three digits.
Adding up the first <math>17</math> of the cycle of <math>20</math>, we can see that the answer is <math>\boxed{069}</math>.
