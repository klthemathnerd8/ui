==Solution 1==

The $6$ green marbles and yellow marbles form $1 - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{12}$ of the total marbles. Now, suppose the total number of marbles is $x$. We know the number of yellow marbles is $\frac{5}{12}x - 6$ and a positive integer. Therefore, $12$ must divide $x$. Trying the smallest multiples of $12$ for $x$, we see that when $x = 12$, we get there are $-1$ yellow marbles, which is impossible. However when $x = 24$, there are $\frac{5}{12} \cdot 24 - 6 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }4}$ yellow marbles, which must be the smallest possible.
