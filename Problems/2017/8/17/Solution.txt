==Solution==
We can represent the amount of gold with $g$ and the amount of chests with $c$. We can use the problem to make the following equations:
$$9c-18 = g$$
$$6c+3 = g$$

We do this because for 9 chests there are 2 empty and if 9 were in each 9 multiplied by 2 is 18 left.

Therefore, $6c+3 = 9c-18.$ This implies that $c = 7.$ We therefore have $g = 45.$ So, our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 45}$.
