==Solution 2==

We know that the perimeters of the two small triangles are $3+CD+AD$ and $4+BD+AD$. Setting both equal and using $BD+CD = 5$, we have $BD = 2$ and $CD = 3$. Now, we simply have to find the area of $\triangle ABD$. Since $\frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{2}{3}$, we must have $\frac{[ABD]}{[ACD]} = 2/3$. Combining this with the fact that $[ABC] = [ABD] + [ACD] = \frac{3\cdot4}{2} = 6$, we get $[ABD] = \frac{2}{5}[ABC] = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 6 = \boxed{\textbf{(D) } \frac{12}{5}}$.
