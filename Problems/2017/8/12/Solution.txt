==Solution 1==

Since the remainder is the same for all numbers, then we will only need to find the lowest common multiple of the three given numbers, and add the given remainder. The $\operatorname{LCM}(4,5,6)$ is $60$. Since $60+1=61$, that is in the range of $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \text{60 and 79}}.$
