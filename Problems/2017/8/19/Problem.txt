==Solution 1==
Factoring out $98!+99!+100!$, we have $98! (1+99+99*100)$, which is $98! (10000)$. Next, $98!$ has $\left\lfloor\frac{98}{5}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{98}{25}\right\rfloor = 19 + 3 = 22$ factors of $5$. The $19$ is because of all the multiples of $5$.The $3$ is because of all the multiples of $25$. Now, $10,000$ has $4$ factors of $5$, so there are a total of $22 + 4 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 26}$ factors of $5$.
