==Solution 1==
We first connect point $B$ with point $D$. 

<asy>draw((0,0)--(2.4,3.6)--(0,5)--(12,0)--(0,0)); draw((0,0)--(0,5)); label("$B$", (0, 0), SW); label("$A$", (12, 0), ESE); label("$C$", (2.4, 3.6), SE); label("$D$", (0, 5), N);</asy> 

We can see that $\triangle BCD$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle. We can also see that $\triangle BDA$ is a right triangle, by the 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple. With these lengths, we can solve the problem. The area of $\triangle BDA$ is $\frac{5\cdot 12}{2}$, and the area of $\triangle BCD$ is $\frac{3\cdot 4}{2}$. Thus, the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $30-6 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 24}.$
