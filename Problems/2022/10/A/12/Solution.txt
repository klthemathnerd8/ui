==Solution 1==

Note that:

* Truth-tellers would answer yes-no-no to the three questions in this order.

* Liars would answer yes-yes-no to the three questions in this order.

* Alternaters who responded truth-lie-truth would answer no-no-no to the three questions in this order.

* Alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie would answer yes-yes-yes to the three questions in this order.

Suppose that there are $T$ truth-tellers, $L$ liars, and $A$ alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie.

The conditions of the first two questions imply that
$$\begin{align*}
T+L+A&=22, \\
L+A&=15.
\end{align*}$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $T=22-15=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 7}.$

<u><b>Remark</b></u>

The condition of the third question is extraneous. However, we know that there are $9$ alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie, $6$ liars, and $9$ alternaters who responded truth-lie-truth from this condition.
