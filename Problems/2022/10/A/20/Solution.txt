==Solution 1 (Algebra)==
Let the arithmetic sequence be $a,a+d,a+2d,a+3d$ and the geometric sequence be $b,br,br^2,br^3.$

We are given that
$$\begin{align*}
a+b&=57, \\
a+d+br&=60, \\
a+2d+br^2&=91,
\end{align*}$$
and we wish to find $a+3d+br^3.$

Subtracting the first equation from the second and the second equation from the third, we get
$$\begin{align*}
d+b(r-1)&=3, \\
d+br(r-1)&=31.
\end{align*}$$
Subtract these results, we get $$b(r-1)^2=28.$$

Note that either $b=28$ or $b=7.$ We proceed with casework:

* If $b=28,$ then $r=2,a=29,$ and $d=-25.$ The arithmetic sequence is $29,4,-21,-46,$ arriving at a contradiction.

* If $b=7,$ then $r=3,a=50,$ and $d=-11.$ The arithmetic sequence is $50,39,28,17,$ and the geometric sequence is $7,21,63,189.$ This case is valid.

Therefore, The answer is $a+3d+br^3=17+189=\boxed{\textbf{(E) } 206}.$
