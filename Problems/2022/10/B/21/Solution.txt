==Solution 1 (Experimentation)==

Given that all the answer choices and coefficients are integers, we hope that $P(x)$ has positive integer coefficients.

Throughout this solution, we will express all polynomials in base $x$. E.g. $x^2 + x + 1 = 111_{x}$.

We are given:
$$111a + 12 = 101b + 21 = P(x).$$
We add $111$ and $101$ to each side and balance respectively:
$$111(a - 1) + 123 = 101(b - 1) + 122 = P(x).$$
We make the unit's digits equal:
$$111(a - 1) + 123 = 101(b - 2) + 223 = P(x).$$
We now notice that:
$$111(a - 11) + 1233 = 101(b - 12) + 1233 = P(x).$$
Therefore $a = 11_{x} = x + 1$, $b = 12_{x} = x + 2$, and $P(x) = 1233_{x} = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 3$. $3$ is the minimal degree of $P(x)$ since there is no way to influence the $x$â€˜s digit in $101b + 21$ when $b$ is an integer. The desired sum is $1^2 + 2^2 +3^2+ 3^2 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)} \ 23}$

P.S. The four computational steps can be deduced through quick experimentation.
