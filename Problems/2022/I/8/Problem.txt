== Problem ==
Equilateral triangle <math>\triangle ABC</math> is inscribed in circle <math>\omega</math> with radius <math>18.</math> Circle <math>\omega_A</math> is tangent to sides <math>\overline{AB}</math> and <math>\overline{AC}</math> and is internally tangent to <math>\omega.</math> Circles <math>\omega_B</math> and <math>\omega_C</math> are defined analogously. Circles <math>\omega_A,</math> <math>\omega_B,</math> and <math>\omega_C</math> meet in six points---two points for each pair of circles. The three intersection points closest to the vertices of <math>\triangle ABC</math> are the vertices of a large equilateral triangle in the interior of <math>\triangle ABC,</math> and the other three intersection points are the vertices of a smaller equilateral triangle in the interior of <math>\triangle ABC.</math> The side length of the smaller equilateral triangle can be written as <math>\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b},</math> where <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are positive integers. Find <math>a+b.</math>
