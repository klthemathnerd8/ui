==Problem==

On Halloween $31$ children walked into the principal's office asking for candy. They
can be classified into three types: Some always lie; some always tell the truth; and
some alternately lie and tell the truth. The alternaters arbitrarily choose their first
response, either a lie or the truth, but each subsequent statement has the opposite
truth value from its predecessor. The principal asked everyone the same three
questions in this order.

"Are you a truth-teller?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $22$
children who answered yes.

"Are you an alternater?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $15$
children who answered yes.

"Are you a liar?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $9$ children who
answered yes.

How many pieces of candy in all did the principal give to the children who always
tell the truth?

$\textbf{(A) } 7 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 12 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 21 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 27 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 31$
