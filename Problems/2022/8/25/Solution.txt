==Solution 1 (Casework)==

Let $A$ denote the leaf where the cricket starts and $B$ denote one of the other $3$ leaves. Note that:

* If the cricket is at $A,$ then the probability that it hops to $B$ next is $1.$

* If the cricket is at $B,$ then the probability that it hops to $A$ next is $\frac13.$

* If the cricket is at $B,$ then the probability that it hops to $B$ next is $\frac23.$

We apply casework to the possible paths of the cricket:
<ol style="margin-left: 1.5em;">
  <li>$A \rightarrow B \rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow A$ <p>
The probability for this case is $1\cdot\frac13\cdot1\cdot\frac13=\frac19.$</li><p>
  <li>$A \rightarrow B \rightarrow B \rightarrow B \rightarrow A$ <p>
The probability for this case is $1\cdot\frac23\cdot\frac23\cdot\frac13=\frac{4}{27}.$</li><p>
</ol>
Together, the probability that the cricket returns to $A$ after $4$ hops is $\frac19+\frac{4}{27}=\boxed{\textbf{(E) }\frac{7}{27}}.$
