== Solution ==

We set up our cases as solution 1 showed, realizing that only the second case is possible. 

We notice that $13$ students have scores under $85$ currently and only $5$ have scores over $85$. We find the median of these two numbers, getting:

$$13-5=8$$
$$\frac{8}{2}=4$$
$$13-4=9$$

Thus, we realize that $4$ students must have their score increased by $5$.

So, the correct answer is $\boxed{(C)4}$.
