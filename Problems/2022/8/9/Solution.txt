==Solution==

Initially, the difference between the water temperature and the room temperature is $212-68=144$ degrees Fahrenheit.

After $5$ minutes, the difference between the temperatures is $144\div2=72$ degrees Fahrenheit.

After $10$ minutes, the difference between the temperatures is $72\div2=36$ degrees Fahrenheit.

After $15$ minutes, the difference between the temperatures is $36\div2=18$ degrees Fahrenheit. At this point, the water temperature is $68+18=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 86}$ degrees Fahrenheit.

<u><b>Remark</b></u>

Alternatively, we can condense the solution above into the following equation: $$68+(212-68)\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^{\tfrac{15}{5}}=86.$$
