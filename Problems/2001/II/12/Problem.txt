== Problem ==
Given a [[triangle]], its [[midpoint]] triangle is obtained by joining the midpoints of its sides. A sequence of [[polyhedra]] <math>P_{i}</math> is defined recursively as follows: <math>P_{0}</math> is a regular [[tetrahedron]] whose volume is 1. To obtain <math>P_{i + 1}</math>, replace the midpoint triangle of every face of <math>P_{i}</math> by an outward-pointing regular tetrahedron that has the midpoint triangle as a face. The [[volume]] of <math>P_{3}</math> is <math>\frac {m}{n}</math>, where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are relatively prime positive integers. Find <math>m + n</math>.
