== Problem ==
A [[set]] of positive numbers has the ''triangle property'' if it has three distinct elements that are the lengths of the sides of a [[triangle]] whose area is positive. Consider sets <math>\{4, 5, 6, \ldots, n\}</math> of consecutive positive integers, all of whose ten-element subsets have the triangle property. What is the largest possible value of <math>n</math>?
