== Problem ==
In a [[rectangle|rectangular]] array of points, with 5 rows and <math>N</math> columns, the points are numbered consecutively from left to right beginning with the top row.  Thus the top row is numbered 1 through <math>N,</math> the second row is numbered <math>N + 1</math> through <math>2N,</math> and so forth.  Five points, <math>P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4,</math> and <math>P_5,</math> are selected so that each <math>P_i</math> is in row <math>i.</math>  Let <math>x_i</math> be the number associated with <math>P_i.</math>  Now renumber the array consecutively from top to bottom, beginning with the first column.  Let <math>y_i</math> be the number associated with <math>P_i</math> after the renumbering.  It is found that <math>x_1 = y_2,</math> <math>x_2 = y_1,</math> <math>x_3 = y_4,</math> <math>x_4 = y_5,</math> and <math>x_5 = y_3.</math>  Find the smallest possible value of <math>N.</math>
