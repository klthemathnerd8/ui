== Problem ==
The numbers <math>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,</math> and <math>8</math> are randomly written on the faces of a regular [[octahedron]] so that each face contains a different number.  The [[probability]] that no two consecutive numbers, where <math>8</math> and <math>1</math> are considered to be consecutive, are written on faces that share an edge is <math>m/n,</math> where <math>m</math> and <math>n</math> are relatively prime positive integers.  Find <math>m + n.</math>
