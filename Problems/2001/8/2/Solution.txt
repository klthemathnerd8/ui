==Solution 1==

Let the numbers be $ x $ and $ y $. Then we have $ x+y=11 $ and $ xy=24 $. Solving for $ x $ in the first equation yields $ x=11-y $, and substituting this into the second equation gives $ (11-y)(y)=24 $. Simplifying this gives $ -y^2+11y=24 $, or $ y^2-11y+24=0 $. This factors as $ (y-3)(y-8)=0 $, so $ y=3 $ or $ y=8 $, and the corresponding $ x $ values are $ x=8 $ and $ x=3 $. These are essentially the same answer: one number is $ 3 $ and one number is $ 8 $, so the largest number is $ 8, \boxed{\text{D}} $.
