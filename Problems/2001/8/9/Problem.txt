==Problem==
To promote her school's annual Kite Olympics, Genevieve makes a small kite and a large kite for a bulletin board display. The kites look like the one in the diagram. For her small kite Genevieve draws the kite on a one-inch grid. For the large kite she triples both the height and width of the entire grid.

<asy>
for (int a = 0; a < 7; ++a)
{
for (int b = 0; b < 8; ++b)
{
dot((a,b));
}
}

draw((3,0)--(0,5)--(3,7)--(6,5)--cycle);
</asy>

The large kite is covered with gold foil. The foil is cut from a rectangular piece that just covers the entire grid. How many square inches of waste material are cut off from the four corners?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 63 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 72 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 180 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 189 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 264$
