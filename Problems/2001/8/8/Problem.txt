==Problem==
To promote her school's annual Kite Olympics, Genevieve makes a small kite and a large kite for a bulletin board display. The kites look like the one in the diagram. For her small kite Genevieve draws the kite on a one-inch grid. For the large kite she triples both the height and width of the entire grid.

<asy>
size(85);
for (int a = 0; a < 7; ++a)
{
for (int b = 0; b < 8; ++b)
{
dot((a,b));
}
}

draw((3,0)--(0,5)--(3,7)--(6,5)--cycle);
</asy>

Genevieve puts bracing on her large kite in the form of a cross connecting opposite corners of the kite. How many inches of bracing material does she need?

$\text{(A)}\ 30 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 32 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 35 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 38 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 39$
