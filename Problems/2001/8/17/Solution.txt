Notice that in two of the increases, the dollar amount doubles. The increases in which this is not true is $ 2 $ to $ 3 $, $ 3 $ to $ 4 $, and $ 11 $ to $ 12 $. We can disregard $ 11 $ to $ 12 $ since that increase is almost $ 2 $ times. The increase from $ 2 $ to $ 3 $ is $ \frac{300-200}{200}=\frac{1}{2} $, so it's only multiplied by a factor of $ 1.5 $. The increase from $ 3 $ to $ 4 $ is $ \frac{500-300}{300}=\frac{2}{3} $, so it is multiplied by a factor of $ 1.\bar{6} $. Therefore, the smallest percent increase is $ \text{From 2 to 3}, \boxed{\text{B}} $
