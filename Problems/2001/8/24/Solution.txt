Each half has $ 3 $ red triangles, $ 5 $ blue triangles, and $ 8 $ white triangles. There are also $ 2 $ pairs of red triangles, so $ 2 $ red triangles on each side are used, leaving $ 1 $ red triangle, $ 5 $ blue triangles, and $ 8 $ white triangles remaining on each half. Also, there are $ 3 $ pairs of blue triangles, using $ 3 $ blue triangles on each side, so there is $ 1 $ red triangle, $ 2 $ blue triangles, and $ 8 $ white triangles remaining on each half. Also, we have $ 2 $ red-white pairs. This obviously can't use $ 2 $ red triangles on one side, since there is only $ 1 $ on each side, so we must use $ 1 $ red triangle and $ 1 $ white triangle per side, leaving $ 2 $ blue triangles and $ 7 $ white triangles apiece. The remaining blue triangles cannot be matched with other blue triangles since that would mean there were more than $ 3 $ blue pairs, so the remaining blue triangles must be paired with white triangles, yielding $ 4 $ blue-white pairs, one for each of the remaining blue triangles. This uses $ 2 $ blue triangles and $ 2 $ white triangles on each side, leaving $ 5 $ white triangles apiece, which must be paired with each other, so there are $ 5 $ white-white pairs, $ \boxed{\text{B}} $.
