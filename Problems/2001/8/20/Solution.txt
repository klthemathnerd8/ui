==Solution==
Since the only other score Quay knows is Kaleana's, and he knows that two of them have the same score, Quay and Kaleana must have the same score, and $ K=Q $. Marty knows that he didn't get the lowest score, and the only other score he knows is Kaleana's, so Marty must know that Kaleana must have a lower score than him, and $ M>K $. Finally, Shana knows that she didn't get the highest score, and the only other score she knows is Kaleana's, so Shana must know that Kaleana must have a higher score than her, and $ S<K $. Putting these together and substituting $ Q $ for $ K $, we have $ S<Q<M $, and from least to greatest this is $ \text{S, Q, M}$, therefore the answer is $\boxed{\text{A}} $.
