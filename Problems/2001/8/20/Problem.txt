==Problem==

Kaleana shows her test score to Quay, Marty and Shana, but the others keep theirs hidden. Quay thinks, "At least two of us have the same score." Marty thinks, "I didn't get the lowest score." Shana thinks, "I didn't get the highest score." List the scores from lowest to highest for Marty (M), Quay (Q) and Shana (S).

$\text{(A)}\ \text{S,Q,M} \qquad \text{(B)}\ \text{Q,M,S} \qquad \text{(C)}\ \text{Q,S,M} \qquad \text{(D)}\ \text{M,S,Q} \qquad \text{(E)}\ \text{S,M,Q}$
