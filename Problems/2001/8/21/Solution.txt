Since there is an odd number of terms, the median is the number in the middle, specifically, the third largest number is $ 18 $, and there are $ 2 $ numbers less than $ 18 $ and $ 2 $ numbers greater than $ 18 $. The sum of these integers is $ 5(15)=75 $, since the mean is $ 15 $. To make the largest possible number with a given sum, the other numbers must be as small as possible. The two numbers less than $ 18 $ must be positive and distinct, so the smallest possible numbers for these are $ 1 $ and $ 2 $. The number right after $ 18 $ also needs to be as small as possible, so it must be $ 19 $. This means that the remaining number, the maximum possible value for a number in the set, is $ 75-1-2-18-19=35, \boxed{\text{(D) 35}} $.
