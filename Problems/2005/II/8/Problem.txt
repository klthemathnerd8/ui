== Problem ==
[[Circle]]s <math> C_1 </math> and <math> C_2 </math> are externally [[tangent]], and they are both internally tangent to circle <math> C_3. </math> The radii of <math> C_1 </math>  and <math> C_2 </math> are 4 and 10, respectively, and the [[center]]s of the three circles are all [[collinear]]. A [[chord]] of <math> C_3 </math> is also a common external tangent of <math> C_1 </math> and <math> C_2. </math> Given that the length of the chord is <math> \frac{m\sqrt{n}}p </math> where <math> m,n, </math> and <math> p </math> are positive integers, <math> m </math> and <math> p </math> are [[relatively prime]], and <math> n </math> is not divisible by the square of any [[prime]], find <math> m+n+p. </math>
