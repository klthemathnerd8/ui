An [[infinite]] [[geometric series]] has sum 2005. A new series, obtained by squaring each term of the original series, has 10 times the sum of the original series. The common [[ratio]] of the original series is <math> \frac mn </math> where <math> m </math> and <math> n </math> are [[relatively prime]] [[integer]]s. Find <math> m+n. </math>
