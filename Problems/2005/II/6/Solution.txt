Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly <math>131 - 1 = 130</math> numbers must be in front of it. There are <math>\frac{130}{2} = 65</math> cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that <math>n = 131 + 65 = 196</math>; the total number of cards is <math>196 \cdot 2 = \boxed{392}</math>.
