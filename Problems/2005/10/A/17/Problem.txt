In the five-sided star shown, the letters $A, B, C, D,$ and $E$ are replaced by the numbers $3, 5, 6, 7,$ and $9$, although not necessarily in this order. The sums of the numbers at the ends of the line segments $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, and $EA$ form an arithmetic sequence, although not necessarily in that order. What is the middle term of the arithmetic sequence?
