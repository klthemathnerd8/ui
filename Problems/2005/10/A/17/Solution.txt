==Solution 1==
Each corner $(A,B,C,D,E)$ goes to two sides/numbers. ($A$ goes to $AE$ and $AB$, $D$ goes to $DC$ and $DE$). The sum of every term is equal to $2(3+5+6+7+9)=60$

Since the middle term in an arithmetic sequence is the average of all the terms in the sequence, the middle number is $\frac{60}{5}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }12}$
