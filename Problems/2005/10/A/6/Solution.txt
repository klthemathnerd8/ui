==Solution==
Since the [[arithmetic mean|average]] of the first $20$ numbers is $30$, their sum is $20\cdot30=600$. 

Since the average of $30$ other numbers is $20$, their sum is $30\cdot20=600$. 

So the sum of all $50$ numbers is $600+600=1200$

Therefore, the average of all $50$ numbers is $\frac{1200}{50}=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }24}$
