Three tiles are marked $X$ and two other tiles are marked $O$. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads $XOXOX$?

$ \textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{12}\qquad \textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{10}\qquad \textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{6}\qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{1}{4}\qquad \textbf{(E) } \frac{1}{3} $
