== Solution 1 ==
We first look at how many times each number will appear in each slot. If we fix a number in a slot, then there are $ 4! = 24 $ ways to arrange the other numbers, so each number appears in each spot $ 24 $ times. Therefore, the sum of all such numbers is $ 24 \times (1+3+5+7+8) \times (11111) = 24 \times 24 \times 11111 = 6399936. $ Since there are $ 5! = 120 $ such numbers, we divide $ 6399936 \div 120 $ to get $ \boxed{\textbf{(C) }53332.8} $
