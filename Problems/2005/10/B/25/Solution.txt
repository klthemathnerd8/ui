==Solution 1==
The question asks for the maximum possible number of elements. The integers from $1$ to $24$ can be included because you cannot make $125$ with integers from $1$ to $24$ without the other number being greater than $100$. The integers from $25$ to $100$ are left. They can be paired so the sum is $125$: $25+100$, $26+99$, $27+98$, $\ldots$, $62+63$. That is $38$ pairs, and at most one number from each pair can be included in the set. The total is $24 + 38 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 62}$.

Also, it is possible to see that since the numbers $1$ to $24$ are in the set there are only the numbers $25$ to $100$ to consider. As $62+63$ gives $125$, the numbers $25$ to $62$ can be put in subset $B$ without having two numbers add up to $125$. In this way, subset $B$ will have the numbers $1$ to $62$, and so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 62}$.

===Solution 1 Alternate Solution===
Since there are $38$ numbers that sum to $125$, there are $100-38=62$ numbers not summing to $125.$
