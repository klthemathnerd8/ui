== Solution 1 (where the order of drawing slips matters) ==
There are $10$ ways to determine which number to pick. There are $4!$ ways to then draw those four slips with that number, and $40 \cdot 39 \cdot 38 \cdot 37$ total ways to draw four slips. Thus $p = \frac{10\cdot 4!}{40 \cdot 39 \cdot 38 \cdot 37}$. 

There are ${10 \choose 2} = 45$ ways to determine which two numbers to pick for the second probability. There are ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ ways to arrange the order which we draw the non-equal slips, and in each order there are $4 \times 3 \times 4 \times 3$ ways to pick the slips, so $q = \frac{45 \cdot 6 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 3^2}{40 \cdot 39 \cdot 38 \cdot 37}$. 

Hence, the answer is $\frac{q}{p} = \frac{45 \cdot 6 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 3^2}{10\cdot 4!} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }162}$.
