After the first day, there is $1-\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\cdot1\right)=\frac{2}{3}$ gallons left. After the second day, there is a total of $\dfrac{2}{3}-\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\times\dfrac{2}{3}\right)=\dfrac{2}{3}-\dfrac{2}{9}=\dfrac{4}{9}$. Therefore, the fraction of the original amount of paint that is left is $\dfrac{\dfrac{4}{9}}{1}=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{4}{9}}$.

Another way to do this is just to simply find the gain everyday and subtract from the remaining you had before.
