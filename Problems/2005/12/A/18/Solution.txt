The given states that there are $168$ prime numbers less than $1000$, which is a fact we must somehow utilize. Since there seems to be no easy way to directly calculate the number of "prime-looking" numbers, we can apply [[complementary counting]]. We can split the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ into several groups: $\{1\},$ $\{\mathrm{numbers\ divisible\ by\ 2 = S_2}\},$ $ \{\mathrm{numbers\ divisible\ by\ 3 = S_3}\},$ $ \{\mathrm{numbers\ divisible\ by\ 5 = S_5}\}, \{\mathrm{primes\ not\ including\ 2,3,5}\},$ $ \{\mathrm{prime-looking}\}$. Hence, the number of prime-looking numbers is $1000 - (168-3) - 1 - |S_2 \cup S_3 \cup S_5|$ (note that $2,3,5$ are primes).

We can calculate $S_2 \cup S_3 \cup S_5$ using the [[Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion]]: (the values of $|S_2| \ldots$ and their intersections can be found quite easily)

<div style="text-align:center;">$|S_2 \cup S_3 \cup S_5| = |S_2| + |S_3| + |S_5| - |S_2 \cap S_3| - |S_3 \cap S_5| - |S_2 \cap S_5| + |S_2 \cap S_3 \cap S_5|$<br />$= 500 + 333 + 200 - 166 - 66 - 100 + 33 = 734$</div>

Substituting, we find that our answer is $1000 - 165 - 1 - 734 = 100 \Longrightarrow \mathrm{(A)}$.
