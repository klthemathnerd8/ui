===Solution 1===

Since $x\%$ means $0.01x$, the statement "$x\% \text{ of } x \text{ is 4}$" can be rewritten as "$0.01x \cdot x = 4$":

$0.01x \cdot x=4 \Rightarrow x^2 = 400 \Rightarrow x = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }20}.$

===Solution 2===

Try the answer choices one by one. Upon examination, it is quite obvious that the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }20}.$ Very fast.
