== Solution ==
We may let $n = 7^k \cdot m$, where $m$ is not divisible by 7. Using the fact that the number of divisors function $d(n)$ is multiplicative, we have $d(n) = d(7^k)d(m) = (k+1)d(m) = 60$. Also, $d(7n) = d(7^{k+1})d(m) = (k+2)d(m) = 80$. These numbers are in the ratio 3:4, so $\frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{3}{4} \implies k = 2 \Rightarrow \boxed{\mathrm{C}}$.
