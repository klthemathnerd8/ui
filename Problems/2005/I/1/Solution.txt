== Solution ==
Define the radii of the six congruent circles as <math>r</math>. If we draw all of the radii to the points of external tangency, we get a [[regular polygon|regular]] [[hexagon]]. If we connect the [[vertex|vertices]] of the hexagon to the [[center]] of the circle <math>C</math>, we form several [[equilateral triangle]]s. The length of each side of the triangle is <math>2r</math>. Notice that the radius of circle <math>C</math> is equal to the length of the side of the triangle plus <math>r</math>. Thus, the radius of <math>C</math> has a length of <math>3r = 30</math>, and so <math>r = 10</math>. <math>K = 30^2\pi - 6(10^2\pi) = 300\pi</math>, so <math>\lfloor 300\pi \rfloor = \boxed{942}</math>.
