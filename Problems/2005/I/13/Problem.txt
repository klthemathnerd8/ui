== Problem ==
A particle moves in the [[Cartesian plane]] according to the following rules:

# From any lattice point <math> (a,b), </math> the particle may only move to <math> (a+1,b), (a,b+1), </math> or <math>(a+1,b+1). </math>
# There are no right angle turns in the particle's path.

How many different paths can the particle take from <math> (0,0) </math> to <math> (5,5) </math>?
