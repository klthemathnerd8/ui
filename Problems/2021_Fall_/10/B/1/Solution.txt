== Solution 1 ==
We see that $1, 2, 3,$ and $4$ each appear in the ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands digit exactly once. Since $1+2+3+4=10$, we find that the sum is equal to $$10\cdot(1+10+100+1000)=\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \: 11{,}110}.$$
Note that it is equally valid to manually add all four numbers together to get the answer.
