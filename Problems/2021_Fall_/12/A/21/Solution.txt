First realize that $\triangle BCY \sim \triangle DAX.$ Thus, because $CY: XA = 2:3,$ we can say that $BY = 2s$ and $DX = 3s.$ From the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $AB^2 =(2s)^2 + 4^2 = 4s^2 + 16$ and $CD^2 = (3s)^2 + 3^2 = 9s^2 + 9.$ Because $AB = CD,$ from the problem statement, we have that $$4s^2 + 16 = 9s^2 + 9.$$ Solving, gives $s = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{5}}.$ To find the area of the trapezoid, we can compute the area of $\triangle ABC$ and add it to the area of $\triangle ACD.$ Thus, the area of the trapezoid is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot 6 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot 6 \right) = \frac{15\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{5}} = 3\sqrt{35}.$ Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} \: 3\sqrt{35}}.$
