By the definition of least common mutiple, we take the greatest powers of the prime numbers of the prime factorization of all the numbers, that we are taking the $\text{lcm}$ of. In this case, $$M = 2^4 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 17 \cdot 19 \cdot 23 \cdot 29.$$ Now, using the same logic, we find that $$N = M \cdot 2 \cdot 37,$$ because we have an extra power of $2$ and an extra power of $37.$ Thus, $\frac{N}{M} = 2\cdot 37 = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 74}.$
