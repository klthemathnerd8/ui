==Solution 1==

Note that we can add $9$ to $R(n)$ to get $R(n+1)$, but must subtract $k$ for all $k|n+1$. Hence, we see that there are four ways to do that because $9=7+2=6+3=5+4=4+3+2$. Note that only $7+2$ is a plausible option, since $4+3+2$ indicates $n+1$ is divisible by $6$, $5+4$ indicates that $n+1$ is divisible by $2$, $6+3$ indicates $n+1$ is divisible by $2$, and $9$ itself indicates divisibility by $3$, too. So, $14|n+1$ and $n+1$ is not divisible by any positive integers from $2$ to $10$, inclusive, except $2$ and $7$. We check and get that only $n+1=14 \cdot 1$ and $n+1=14 \cdot 7$ give possible solutions so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }2}$.
