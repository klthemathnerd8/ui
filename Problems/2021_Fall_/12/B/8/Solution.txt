==Solution 1 (Area)==

Let the lengths of the two congruent sides of the triangle be $x$, then the product desired is $x^2$.

Notice that the product of the base and twice the height is $4$ times the area of the triangle.

Set the vertex angle to be $a$, we derive the equation:

$x^2=4\left(\frac{1}{2}x^2\sin(a)\right)$

$\sin(a)=\frac{1}{2}$

As the triangle is obtuse, $a=150^\circ$ only. We get $\boxed{\textbf{(D)} \ 150}.$
