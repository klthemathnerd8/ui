==Problem==

A bug starts at a vertex of a grid made of equilateral triangles of side length $1$. At each step the bug moves in one of the $6$ possible directions along the grid lines randomly and independently with equal probability. What is the probability that after $5$ moves the bug never will have been more than $1$ unit away from the starting position?
