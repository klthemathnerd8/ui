==Solution 1==

Let $a=\cos(x)+i\sin(x)$. Now $P(a)=1+a-a^2+a^3$. $P(-1)=-2$ and $P(0)=1$ so there is a real root $a_1$ between $-1$ and $0$. The other $a$'s must be complex conjugates since all coefficients of the polynomial are real. The magnitude of those complex $a$'s squared is $\frac{1}{a_1}$ which is greater than $1$. If $x$ is real number then $a$ must have magnitude of $1$, but none of the solutions for $a$ have magnitude of $1$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0 }$ ~lopkiloinm
