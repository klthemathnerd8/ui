We will use complementary counting to find the probability that the product is not divisible by $4$. Then, we can find the probability that we want by subtracting this from 1. We split this into $2$ cases. 

Case 1: The product is not divisible by $2$.

We need every number to be odd, and since the chance we roll an odd number is $\frac12,$ our probability is $\left(\frac12\right)^6=\frac1{64}.$

Case 2: The product is divisible by $2$, but not by $4$.

We need $5$ numbers to be odd, and one to be divisible by $2$, but not by $4$. There is a $\frac12$ chance that an odd number is rolled, a $\frac13$ chance that we roll a number satisfying the second condition (only $2$ and $6$ work), and $6$ ways to choose the order in which the even number appears.

Our probability is $\left(\frac12\right)^5\left(\frac13\right)\cdot6=\frac1{16}.$

Therefore, the probability the product is not divisible by $4$ is $\frac1{64}+\frac1{16}=\frac{5}{64}$.

Our answer is $1-\frac{5}{64}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{59}{64}}$.
