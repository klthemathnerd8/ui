The volume of this pyramid can be found by the equation <math>V=\frac{1}{3}bh</math>, where <math>b</math> is the base and <math>h</math> is the height. The base is easy, since it is a square and has area <math>15^2=225</math>.


To find the height of the pyramid, the height of the four triangles is needed, which will be called <math>h^\prime</math>. By drawing a line through the middle of the larger square, we see that its length is equal to the length of the smaller rectangle and two of the triangle's heights. Then <math>40=2h^\prime +15</math>, which means that  <math>h^\prime=12.5</math>.


When the pyramid is made, you see that the height is the one of the legs of a right triangle, with the hypotenuse equal to <math>h^\prime</math> and the other leg having length equal to half of the side length of the smaller square, or <math>7.5</math>. So, the Pythagorean Theorem can be used to find the height.

<math>h=\sqrt{12.5^2-7.5^2}=\sqrt{100}=10</math> 

Finally, <math>V=\frac{1}{3}bh=\frac{1}{3}(225)(10)=\boxed{750}</math>.
