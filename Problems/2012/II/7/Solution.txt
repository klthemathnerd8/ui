Okay, an exercise in counting (lots of binomials to calculate!).  In base 2, the first number is <math>11111111</math>, which is the only way to choose 8 1's out of 8 spaces, or <math>\binom{8}{8}</math>.  What about 9 spaces?  Well, all told, there are <math>\binom{9}{8}=9</math>, which includes the first 1.  Similarly, for 10 spaces, there are <math>\binom{10}{8}=45,</math> which includes the first 9.  For 11 spaces, there are <math>\binom{11}{8}=165</math>, which includes the first 45.  You're getting the handle.  For 12 spaces, there are <math>\binom{12}{8}=495</math>, which includes the first 165; for 13 spaces, there are <math>\binom{13}{8}=13 \cdot 99 > 1000</math>, so we now know that <math>N</math> has exactly 13 spaces, so the <math>2^{12}</math> digit is 1.  

Now we just proceed with the other 12 spaces with 7 1's, and we're looking for the <math>1000-495=505th</math> number.  Well, <math>\binom{11}{7}=330</math>, so we know that the <math>2^{11}</math> digit also is 1, and we're left with finding the <math>505-330=175th</math> number with 11 spaces and 6 1's.  Now <math>\binom{10}{6}=210,</math> which is too big, but <math>\binom{9}{6}=84.</math>  Thus, the <math>2^9</math> digit is 1, and we're now looking for the <math>175-84=91st</math> number with 9 spaces and 5 1's.  Continuing the same process, <math>\binom{8}{5}=56</math>, so the <math>2^8</math> digit is 1, and we're left to look for the <math>91-56=35th</math> number with 8 spaces and 4 1's.  But here <math>\binom{7}{4}=35</math>, so N must be the last or largest 7-digit number with 4 1's.  Thus the last 8 digits of <math>N</math> must be <math>01111000</math>, and to summarize, <math>N=1101101111000</math> in base <math>2</math>.  Therefore, <math>N = 8+16+32+64+256+512+2048+4096 \equiv 32 \pmod{1000}</math>, and the answer is <math>\boxed{032}</math>.
