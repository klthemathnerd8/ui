It is apparent that for a perfect square <math>s^2</math> to satisfy the constraints, we must have <math>s^2 - 256 = 1000n</math> or <math>(s+16)(s-16) = 1000n.</math> Now in order for <math>(s+16)(s-16)</math> to be a multiple of <math>1000,</math> at least one of <math>s+16</math> and <math>s-16</math> must be a multiple of <math>5,</math> and since <math>s+16 \not\equiv s-16 \pmod{5},</math> one term must have all the factors of <math>5</math> and thus must be a multiple of <math>125.</math> Furthermore, each of <math>s+16</math> and <math>s-16</math> must have at least two factors of <math>2,</math> since otherwise <math>(s+16)(s-16)</math> could not possibly be divisible by <math>8.</math> So therefore the conditions are satisfied if either <math>s+16</math> or <math>s-16</math> is divisible by <math>500,</math> or equivalently if <math>s = 500n \pm 16.</math> Counting up from <math>n=0</math> to <math>n=5,</math> we see that the tenth value of <math>s</math> is <math>500 \cdot 5 - 16 = 2484</math> and thus the corresponding element in <math>\mathcal{T}</math> is <math>\frac{2484^2 - 256}{1000} = 6170 \rightarrow \boxed{170.}</math>
