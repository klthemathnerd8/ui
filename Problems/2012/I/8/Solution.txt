== Solution: think outside the box (pun intended) ==
Define a coordinate system with <math>D</math> at the origin and <math>C,</math> <math>A,</math> and <math>H</math> on the <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math> axes respectively. Then <math>D=(0,0,0),</math> <math>M=(.5,1,0),</math> and <math>N=(1,0,.5).</math> It follows that the plane going through <math>D,</math> <math>M,</math> and <math>N</math> has equation <math>2x-y-4z=0.</math> Let <math>Q = (1,1,.25)</math> be the intersection of this plane and edge <math>BF</math> and let <math>P = (1,2,0).</math> Now since <math>2(1) - 1(2) - 4(0) = 0,</math> <math>P</math> is on the plane. Also, <math>P</math> lies on the extensions of segments <math>DM,</math> <math>NQ,</math> and <math>CB</math> so the solid <math>DPCN = DMBCQN + MPBQ</math> is a right triangular pyramid. Note also that pyramid <math>MPBQ</math> is similar to <math>DPCN</math> with scale factor <math>.5</math> and thus the volume of solid <math>DMBCQN,</math> which is one of the solids bounded by the cube and the plane, is <math>[DPCN] - [MPBQ] = [DPCN] - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3[DPCN] = \frac{7}{8}[DPCN].</math> But the volume of <math>DPCN</math> is simply the volume of a pyramid with base <math>1</math> and height <math>.5</math> which is <math>\frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 \cdot .5 = \frac{1}{6}.</math> So <math>[DMBCQN] = \frac{7}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{7}{48}.</math> Note, however, that this volume is less than <math>.5</math> and thus this solid is the smaller of the two solids. The desired volume is then <math>[ABCDEFGH] - [DMBCQN] = 1 - \frac{7}{48} = \frac{41}{48} \rightarrow p+q = \boxed{089.}</math>

*Another way to finish after using coordinates: Take the volume of DMBCNQ as the sum of the volumes of DMBQ and DBCNQ. Then, we have the sum of the volumes of a tetrahedron and a pyramid with a trapezoidal base. Their volumes, respectively, are <math>\tfrac{1}{48}</math> and <math>\tfrac{1}{8}</math>, giving the same answer as above. <math>\blacksquare</math> ~mathtiger6
