Two parabolas have equations $y= x^2 + ax +b$ and $y= x^2 + cx +d$, where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are integers, each chosen independently by rolling a fair six-sided die. What is the probability that the parabolas will have at least one point in common?

$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{2}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{25}{36}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{5}{6}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{31}{36}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 1$
