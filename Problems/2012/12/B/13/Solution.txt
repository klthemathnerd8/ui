===Solution 1===

Set the two equations equal to each other: $x^2 + ax + b = x^2 + cx + d$. Now remove the x squared and get $x$'s on one side: $ax-cx=d-b$. Now factor $x$: $x(a-c)=d-b$. If $a$ cannot equal $c$, then there is always a solution, but if $a=c$, a $1$ in $6$ chance, leaving a $1080$ out $1296$, always having at least one point in common. And if $a=c$, then the only way for that to work, is if $d=b$, a $1$ in $36$ chance, however, this can occur $6$ ways, so a $1$ in $6$ chance of this happening. So adding one  thirty sixth to $\frac{1080}{1296}$, we get the simplified fraction of $\frac{31}{36}$; answer $\boxed{(D)}$.

===Solution 2===

Proceed as above to obtain $x(a-c)=d-b$. The probability that the parabolas have at least 1 point in common is 1 minus the probability that they do not intersect. The equation $x(a-c)=d-b$ has no solution if and only if $a=c$ and $d\neq b$. The probability that $a=c$ is $\frac{1}{6}$ while the probability that $d\neq b$ is $\frac{5}{6}$. Thus we have $1-\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)=\frac{31}{36}$ for the probability that the parabolas intersect.

===Solution 3=== 

Clearly, $ax + b = cx + d$. Imagine the two sides as lines - they will have no solutions when the two lines are parallel (eg. have the same gradient) which is when $a$ is not equal to $c$. Also, if $b = d$ and $a = c$, they're the same line so we must add one case. There are $36$ combinations of $a$ and $c$, of which they are equal in $6$ - but we must subtract 1 as if $a=c$ but $b=d$ they still intersect and have solutions. So we subtract this to obtain $\frac{36}{36} - \frac{5}{36} = \frac{31}{36}$.
