If the original radius is $12$, then the circumference is $24\pi$; since arcs are defined by the central angles, the smaller arc, a $120$ degree angle, is half the size of the larger sector. so the smaller arc is $8\pi$, and the larger is $16\pi$. Those two arc lengths become the two circumferences of the new cones; so the radius of the smaller cone is $4$ and the larger cone is $8$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the height of the larger cone is $4\cdot\sqrt{5}$ and the smaller cone is $8\cdot\sqrt{2}$, and now for volume just square the radii and multiply by $\tfrac{1}{3}$ of the height to get the volume of each cone: $128\cdot\sqrt{2}$ and $256\cdot\sqrt{5}$ [both multiplied by three as ratio come out the same. now divide the volumes by each other to get the final ratio of $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{\sqrt{10}}{10}}$
