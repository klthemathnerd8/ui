==Solution 1==

The first curve is a circle with radius $5$ centered at the origin, and the second curve is an ellipse with center $(4,0)$ and end points of $(-5,0)$ and $(13,0)$. Finding points of intersection, we get $(-5,0)$, $(4,3)$, and $(4,-3)$, forming a triangle with height of $9$ and base of $6.$ So the area of this triangle is $9 \cdot 6 \cdot 0.5 =27 \textbf{ (B)}.$
