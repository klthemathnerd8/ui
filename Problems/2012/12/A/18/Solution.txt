Inscribe circle $C$ of radius $r$ inside triangle $ABC$ so that it meets $AB$ at $Q$, $BC$ at $R$, and $AC$ at $S$. Note that angle bisectors of triangle $ABC$ are concurrent at the center $O$(also $I$) of circle $C$. Let $x=QB$, $y=RC$ and $z=AS$. Note that $BR=x$, $SC=y$ and $AQ=z$. Hence $x+z=27$, $x+y=25$, and $z+y=26$. Subtracting the last 2 equations we have $x-z=-1$ and adding this to the first equation we have $x=13$. 

By Heron's formula for the area of a triangle we have that the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\sqrt{39(14)(13)(12)}$. On the other hand the area is given by $(1/2)25r+(1/2)26r+(1/2)27r$.  Then $39r=\sqrt{39(14)(13)(12)}$ so that $r^2=56$.

Since the radius of circle $O$ is perpendicular to $BC$ at $R$, we have by the pythagorean theorem $BO^2=BI^2=r^2+x^2=56+169=225$ so that $BI=\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 15}$.
