Let $S$ be the square one of whose diagonals has endpoints $(1/10,7/10)$ and $(-1/10,-7/10)$.  A point $v=(x,y)$ is chosen uniformly at random over all pairs of real numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $0 \le x \le 2012$ and $0\le y\le 2012$.  Let $T(v)$ be a translated copy of $S$ centered at $v$.  What is the probability that the square region determined by $T(v)$ contains exactly two points with integer coefficients in its interior?

$ \textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{8}\qquad\textbf{(B) }\frac{7}{50}\qquad\textbf{(C) }\frac{4}{25}\qquad\textbf{(D) }\frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(E) }\frac{8}{25} $
