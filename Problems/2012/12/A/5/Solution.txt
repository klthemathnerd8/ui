So let the number of blueberries be $b,$ the number of raspberries be $r,$ the number of grapes be $g,$ and finally the number of cherries be $c.$

Observe that since there are $280$ pieces of fruit,
$$b+r+g+c=280.$$

Since there are twice as many raspberries as blueberries,
$$2b=r.$$

The fact that there are three times as many grapes as cherries implies,
$$3c=g.$$

Because there are four times as many cherries as raspberries, we deduce the following:
$$4r=c.$$

Note that we are looking for $c.$  So, we try to rewrite all of the other variables in terms of $c.$
The third equation gives us the value of $g$ in terms of $c$ already.  We divide the fourth equation by $4$ to get that $r=\frac{c}{4}.$  Finally, substituting this value of $r$ into the first equation provides us with the equation $b=\frac{c}{8}$ and substituting yields:
$$\frac{c}{4}+\frac{c}{8}+3c+c=280$$
Multiply this equation by $8$ to get:
$$2c+c+24c+8c=8\cdot 280,$$
$$35c=8\cdot 280,$$
$$c=64.$$
$$\boxed{D}$$
