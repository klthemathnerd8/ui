== Solution ==

Note that if $n$ is the number of friends each person has, then $n$ can be any integer from $1$ to $4$, inclusive.

One person can have at most 4 friends since they cannot be all friends (stated in the problem).

Also note that the cases of $n=1$ and $n=4$ are the same, since a map showing a solution for $n=1$ can correspond one-to-one with a map of a solution for $n=4$ by simply making every pair of friends non-friends and vice versa.  The same can be said of configurations with $n=2$ when compared to configurations of $n=3$.  Thus, we have two cases to examine, $n=1$ and $n=2$, and we count each of these combinations twice.

(Note: If you arenâ€™t familiar with one-to-one correspondences, think of it like this: the number of ways to choose 4 friends is equal to number of ways to exclude one friend from your friend group. Hence, since the number of ways to choose 1 friend is the same thing as choosing 1 to not be friends with, $n=1$ and $n=4$ have the same number of ways. Similarly, $n=2$ and $n=3$ have the same number of ways as well. ~peelybonehead)

For $n=1$, if everyone has exactly one friend, that means there must be $3$ pairs of friends, with no other interconnections.  The first person has $5$ choices for a friend.  There are $4$ people left.  The next person has $3$ choices for a friend.  There are two people left, and these remaining two must be friends.  Thus, there are $15$ configurations with $n=1$.

For $n=2$, there are two possibilities.  The group of $6$ can be split into two groups of $3$, with each group creating a friendship triangle.  The first person has $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to pick two friends from the other five, while the other three are forced together.  Thus, there are $10$ triangular configurations.  

However, the group can also form a friendship hexagon, with each person sitting on a vertex, and each side representing the two friends that person has.  The first person may be seated anywhere on the hexagon [[without loss of generality]].  This person has $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ choices for the two friends on the adjoining vertices.  Each of the three remaining people can be seated "across" from one of the original three people, forming a different configuration.  Thus, there are $10 \cdot 3! = 60$ hexagonal configurations, and in total $70$ configurations for $n=2$.

As stated before, $n=3$ has $70$ configurations, and $n=4$ has $15$ configurations.  This gives a total of $(70 + 15)\cdot 2 = 170$ configurations, which is option $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 170}$.

=== Note ===

We can also calculate the triangular configurations by applying $\frac{\binom{6}{3}}{2} = \frac{20}{2}=10$ (Because choosing $A$,$B$ and $C$ is the same as choosing $D$,$E$ and $F$.


For the hexagonal configurations, we know that the total amount of combinations is $6!=720$. However, we must correct for our  overcounting because of rotation and reflection. We have that there are ${720 \over 6 \cdot 2} = 60$ because there $6$ rotations of the hexagon and 2 reflections (clockwise and counterclockwise) for each valid way.

=== Note 2 ===
We can also calculate the hexagonal configurations by placing each person at a random vertex (6!) and dividing for rotations (by 6) and reflections (by 2): 
                                                 $\frac{6!}{12}=60$

=== Note 3 ===

For the hexagonal configuration, it is essentially congruent to counting the number of paths that start and end with A. From $A$, we have $5$ options, then the next one has $4$, and so on, so we have: $5\cdot 4 \hdots 1 \cdot 1$, where the final $1$ is because the final point needs to reconnect to $A$. Thus, there are $5! = 120$ ways. Dividng by $2$ since we overcounted by accounting for both directions, we have $120/2 = \fbox{60}$
