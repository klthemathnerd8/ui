==Solution 1==
Let the three numbers be equal to $a$, $b$, and $c$. We can now write three equations:

$a+b=12$

$b+c=17$

$a+c=19$

Adding these equations together, we get that

$2(a+b+c)=48$ and

$a+b+c=24$

Substituting the original equations into this one, we find

$c+12=24$

$a+17=24$

$b+19=24$

Therefore, our numbers are 12, 7, and 5. The middle number is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7}$
