==Solution 1==

This tetrahedron has the 4 vertices in these positions: on a corner (lets call this $A$) of the cube, and the other three corners ($B$, $C$, and $D$) adjacent to this corner. We can find the height of the remaining portion of the cube by finding the height of the tetrahedron. We can find the height of this tetrahedron in perspective to the equilateral triangle base (we call this height $x$) by finding the volume of the tetrahedron in two ways. $\frac{1 \times 1}{2}$ is the area of the isosceles base of the tetrahedron. Multiply by the height, $1$, and divide by $3$, we have the volume of the tetrahedron as $\frac{1}{6}$. We set this area equal to one-third the product of our desired height and the area of the equilateral triangle base. First, find the area of the equilateral triangle: $[BCD]=\frac{\sqrt{2}^2 \times \sqrt{3}}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. So we have: $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot x=\frac{1}{6}$, and so $x=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$. 

Since we know what the height is, we can find the height of the remaining structure. The height of the structure if the tetrahedron was still on would simply be the space diagonal of the cube, $\sqrt{3}$, so we just subtract $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$ from $\sqrt{3}$ to get $\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$, or $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}.$
