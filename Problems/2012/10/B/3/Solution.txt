== Solution ==

The line $y = 2000$ is a horizontal line located $12$ units beneath the point $(1000, 2012)$. When a point is reflected about a horizontal line, only the $y$ - coordinate will change. The $x$ - coordinate remains the same. Since the $y$-coordinate of the point is $12$ units above the line of reflection, the new $y$ - coordinate  will be $2000 - 12 = 1988$. Thus, the coordinates of the reflected point are $(1000, 1988)$. $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$
