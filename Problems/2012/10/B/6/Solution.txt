== Solution ==

Let's define $z$ as the amount rounded up by and down by.

The problem statement tells us that Xiaoli performed the following computation:

$\left(x+z\right) - \left(y-z\right) = x+z-y+z = x-y+2z$

We can see that $x-y+2z$ is greater than $x-y$, and so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } \text{Her estimate is larger than } x-y}$.
