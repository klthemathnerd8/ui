==Solution ==
This question can be solved by considering all the possibilities:

$1$ out of $500$ people will have the disease and will be tested positive for the disease.

Out of the remaining $499$ people, $2\%$, or $9.98$ people, will be tested positive for the disease incorrectly.

Therefore, $p$ can be found by taking $\dfrac{1}{1+9.98}$, which is closest to $\dfrac{1}{1+10}$ or $\dfrac{1}{11}$,or $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$
