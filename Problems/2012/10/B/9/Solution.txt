== Solution ==

Out of the first two integers, it's possible for both to be even: for example, $10 + 16 = 26.$ But the next two integers, when added, increase the sum by $15,$ which is odd, so one of them must be odd and the other must be even: for example, $3 + 12 = 15.$ Finally, the next two integers increase the sum by $16,$ which is even, so we can have both be even: for example, $2 + 14 = 16.$ Therefore, $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 1}$ is the minimum number of integers that must be odd.

You can use the sum of each pairs of numbers and take mod 2. See [[modular arithmetic]]
