Isabella wants an average grade of $ 95 $ on her 4 tests; this also means that she wants the sum of her test scores to be at least $95 \times 4 = 380$ (if she goes over this number, she'll be over her goal!). She's already taken two tests, which sum to $97+91 = 188$, which means she needs $192$ more points to achieve her desired average. In order to minimize the score on the third test, we assume that Isabella will receive all $100$ points on the fourth test. Therefore, the lowest Isabella could have scored on the third test would be $ 192-100 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 92} $.
