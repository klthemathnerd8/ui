==Problem==
On February 13 ''The Oshkosh Northwester'' listed the length of daylight as 10 hours and 24 minutes, the sunrise was $ 6:57\textsc{am} $, and the sunset as $ 8:15\textsc{pm} $. The length of daylight and sunrise were correct, but the sunset was wrong. When did the sun really set?

$ \textbf{(A)}\hspace{.05in}5:10\textsc{pm}\quad\textbf{(B)}\hspace{.05in}5:21\textsc{pm}\quad\textbf{(C)}\hspace{.05in}5:41\textsc{pm}\quad\textbf{(D)}\hspace{.05in}5:57\textsc{pm}\quad\textbf{(E)}\hspace{.05in}6:03\textsc{pm} $
