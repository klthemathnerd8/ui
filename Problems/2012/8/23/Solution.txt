==Solution 1==
Let the perimeter of the equilateral triangle be $ 3s $. The side length of the equilateral triangle would then be $ s $ and the sidelength of the hexagon would be $ \frac{s}{2} $.

A hexagon contains six equilateral triangles. One of these triangles would be similar to the large equilateral triangle in the ratio $ 1 : 4 $, since the sidelength of the small equilateral triangle is half the sidelength of the large one. Thus, the area of one of the small equilateral triangles is $ 1 $. The area of the hexagon is then $ 1 \times 6 = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 6} $.
