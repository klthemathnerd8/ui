In order to find the area of the frame, we need to subtract the area of the photograph from the area of the photograph and the frame together. The area of the photograph is $ 8 \times 10 = 80 $ square inches. The height of the whole frame (including the photograph) would be $ 8+2+2 = 12$, and the width of the whole frame,  $ 10+2+2 = 14 $. Therefore, the area of the whole figure would be $ 12 \times 14 = 168 $ square inches. Subtracting the area of the photograph from the area of both the frame and photograph, we find the answer to be $168-80 = \boxed{\textbf{(E)}\ 88} $.
