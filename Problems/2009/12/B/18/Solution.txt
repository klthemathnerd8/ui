After $10$ minutes $(600$ seconds$),$ Rachel will have completed $6$ laps and be $30$ seconds from completing her seventh lap. Because Rachel runs one-fourth of a lap in $22.5$ seconds, she will be in the picture between $18.75$ seconds and $41.25$ seconds of the tenth minute.  After 10 minutes, Robert will have completed $7$ laps and be $40$ seconds from completing his eighth lap.  Because Robert runs one-fourth of a lap in $20$ seconds, he will be in the picture between $30$ seconds and $50$ seconds of the tenth minute.  Hence both Rachel and Robert will be in the picture if it is taken between $30$ seconds and $41.25$ seconds of the tenth minute.  So the probability that both runners are in the picture is $\frac {41.25 - 30} {60} = \boxed{\frac {3}{16}}$.  The answer is $\mathrm{(C)}$.
