=== Solution 1 ===

We can rewrite the two given fractions as $\frac 3{12}$ and $\frac 9{12}$. (We multiplied all numerators and denominators by $3$.)

Now it is obvious that the interval between them is divided into three parts by the fractions $\boxed{\frac 5{12}}$ and $\frac 7{12}$.

=== Solution 2 ===

The number we seek can be obtained as a weighted average of the two endpoints, where the closer one has weight $2$ and the further one $1$. We compute:

$$
\dfrac{ 2\cdot\frac 14 + 1\cdot\frac 34 }3
=
\dfrac{ \frac 54 }3
=
\boxed{\dfrac 5{12}}
$$
