== Solution 1 == 
We know that $i^x$ cycles every $4$ powers so we group the sum in $4$s. 
$$i+2i^2+3i^3+4i^4=2-2i$$
$$5i^5+6i^6+7i^7+8i^8=2-2i$$

We can postulate that every group of $4$ is equal to $2-2i$.
For 24 groups we thus, get $48-48i$ as our sum. 
We know the solution must lie near
The next term is the $24*4+1=97$th term. This term is equal to $97i$ (first in a group of $4$ so $i^{97}=i$) and our sum is now $48+49i$ so $n=97\Rightarrow\boxed{\mathbf{D}}$ is our answer
