== Solution ==

Let the original cube have edge length $a$. Then its volume is $a^3$.
The new box has dimensions $a-1$, $a$, and $a+1$, hence its volume is $(a-1)a(a+1) = a^3-a$. 
The difference between the two volumes is $a$. As we are given that the difference is $5$, we have $a=5$, and the volume of the original cube was $5^3 = 125\Rightarrow\boxed{\text{(D)}}$.
