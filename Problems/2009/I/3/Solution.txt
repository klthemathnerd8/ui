The probability of three heads and five tails is <math>\binom {8}{3}p^3(1-p)^5</math> and the probability of five heads and three tails is <math>\binom {8}{3}p^5(1-p)^3</math>.

<cmath>\begin{align*}
25\binom {8}{3}p^3(1-p)^5&=\binom {8}{3}p^5(1-p)^3 \\
25(1-p)^2&=p^2 \\
25p^2-50p+25&=p^2 \\
24p^2-50p+25&=0 \\
p&=\frac {5}{6}\end{align*}</cmath>

Therefore, the answer is <math>5+6=\boxed{011}</math>.
