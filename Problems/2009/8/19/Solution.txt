There are 3 cases: where $ x^\circ$ is a base angle with the $ 70^\circ$ as the other angle, where $ x^\circ$ is a base angle with $ 70^\circ$ as the vertex angle, and where $ x^\circ$ is the vertex angle with $ 70^\circ$ as a base angle.

Case 1: $ x^\circ$ is a base angle with the $ 70^\circ$ as the other angle:
Here, $ x=70$, since base angles are congruent.

Case 2: $ x^\circ$ is a base angle with $ 70^\circ$ as the vertex angle:
Here, the 2 base angles are both $ x^\circ$, so we can use the equation $ 2x+70=180$, which simplifies to $ x=55$.

Case 3: $ x^\circ$ is the vertex angle with $ 70^\circ$ as a base angle:
Here, both base angles are $ 70^\circ$, since base angles are congruent. Thus, we can use the equation $ x+140=180$, which simplifies to $ x=40$.

Adding up all the cases, we get $70+55+40=165$, so the answer is $ \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\    165}$.
