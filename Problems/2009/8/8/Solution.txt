==Solution==
In a rectangle with dimensions $10 \times 10$, the new rectangle would have dimensions $11 \times 9$. The ratio of the new area to the old area is $99/100 = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 99}$.

===Solution 2===
If you take the length as $x$ and the width as $y$ then
A(OLD)= $xy$
A(NEW)= $1.1x\times.9y$ = $.99xy$
$0.99/1=99\%$
