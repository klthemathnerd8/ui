A sequence of numbers starts with $ 1$, $ 2$, and $ 3$. The fourth number of the sequence is the sum of the previous three numbers in the sequence: $ 1+2+3=6$. In the same way, every number after the fourth is the sum of the previous three numbers. What is the eighth number in the sequence? 

$ \textbf{(A)}\  11  \qquad
\textbf{(B)}\   20  \qquad
\textbf{(C)}\   37  \qquad
\textbf{(D)}\   68  \qquad
\textbf{(E)}\    99$
