== Problem ==
Three distinct vertices of a cube are chosen at random. What is the probability that the plane determined by these three vertices contains points inside the cube?

$
\mathrm{(A)}\ \frac{1}{4}
\qquad
\mathrm{(B)}\ \frac{3}{8}
\qquad
\mathrm{(C)}\ \frac{4}{7}
\qquad
\mathrm{(D)}\ \frac{5}{7}
\qquad
\mathrm{(E)}\ \frac{3}{4}
$
