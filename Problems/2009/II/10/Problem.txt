==Problem==
Four lighthouses are located at points <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>C</math>, and <math>D</math>. The lighthouse at <math>A</math> is <math>5</math> kilometers from the lighthouse at <math>B</math>, the lighthouse at <math>B</math> is <math>12</math> kilometers from the lighthouse at <math>C</math>, and the lighthouse at <math>A</math> is <math>13</math> kilometers from the lighthouse at <math>C</math>. To an observer at <math>A</math>, the angle determined by the lights at <math>B</math> and <math>D</math> and the angle determined by the lights at <math>C</math> and <math>D</math> are equal. To an observer at <math>C</math>, the angle determined by the lights at <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> and the angle determined by the lights at <math>D</math> and <math>B</math> are equal. The number of kilometers from <math>A</math> to <math>D</math> is given by <math>\frac {p\sqrt{q}}{r}</math>, where <math>p</math>, <math>q</math>, and <math>r</math> are relatively prime positive integers, and <math>r</math> is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find <math>p</math> + <math>q</math> + <math>r</math>.
