==Solution 1==
Let us call the quantity <math>\frac{a^3b^3+1}{a^3+b^3}</math> as <math>N</math> for convenience. Knowing that <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are positive integers, we can legitimately rearrange the given inequality so that <math>a</math> is by itself, which makes it easier to determine the pairs of <math>(a, b)</math> that work. Doing so, we have <cmath>\frac{ab+1}{a+b} < \frac{3}{2}</cmath> <cmath>\implies 2ab + 2 < 3a + 3b \implies 2ab - 3a < 3b - 2</cmath> <cmath>\implies a < \frac{3b - 2}{2b - 3}.</cmath> Now, observe that if <math>b = 1</math> we have that <math>N = \frac{a^3 + 1}{a^3 + 1} = 1</math>, regardless of the value of <math>a</math>. If <math>a = 1</math>, we have the same result: that <math>N = \frac{b^3 + 1}{b^3 + 1} = 1</math>, regardless of the value of <math>b</math>. Hence, we want to find pairs of positive integers <math>(a, b)</math> existing such that neither <math>a</math> nor <math>b</math> is equal to <math>1</math>, and that the conditions given in the problem are satisfied in order to check that the maximum value for <math>N</math> is not <math>1</math>.


To avoid the possibility that <math>a = 1</math>, we want to find values of <math>b</math> such that <math>\frac{3b - 2}{2b - 3} > 2</math>. If we do this, we will have that <math>a < \frac{3b - 2}{2b - 3} = k</math>, where <math>k</math> is greater than <math>2</math>, and this allows us to choose values of <math>a</math> greater than <math>1</math>. Again, since <math>b</math> is a positive integer, and we want <math>b > 1</math>, we can legitimately multiply both sides of <math>\frac{3b - 2}{2b - 3} > 2</math> by <math>2b - 3</math> to get <math>3b - 2 > 4b - 6 \implies b < 4</math>. For <math>b = 3</math>, we have that <math>a < \frac{7}{3}</math>, so the only possibility for <math>a</math> greater than <math>1</math> is obviously <math>2</math>. Plugging these values into <math>N</math>, we have that <math>N = \frac{8(27) + 1}{8 + 27} = \frac{217}{35} = \frac{31}{5}</math>. For <math>b = 2</math>, we have that <math>a < \frac{4}{1} = 4</math>. Plugging <math>a = 3</math> and <math>b = 2</math> in for <math>N</math> yields the same result of <math>\frac{31}{5}</math>, but plugging <math>a = 2</math> and <math>b = 2</math> into <math>N</math> yields that <math>N = \frac{8(8) + 1}{8 + 8} = \frac{65}{16}</math>. Clearly, <math>\frac{31}{5}</math> is the largest value we can have for <math>N</math>, so our answer is <math>31 + 5 = \boxed{036}</math>.

(Technically, we would have to find that b > 1 before dividing both sides of the inequality by 2b - 3, but otherwise this solution is correct)
