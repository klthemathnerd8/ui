The simple recurrence can be found.

When inserting an integer <math>n</math> into a string with <math>n - 1</math> integers, we notice that the integer <math>n</math> has 3 spots where it can go: before <math>n - 1</math>, before <math>n - 2</math>, and at the very end.

Ex. Inserting 4 into the string 123:
4 can go before the 2 (1423), before the 3 (1243), and at the very end (1234).

Only the addition of the next number, <math>n</math>, will change anything.

Thus the number of permutations with <math>n</math> elements is three times the number of permutations with <math>n-1</math> elements. 

Start with <math>n=3</math> since all <math>6</math> permutations work. And go up: <math>18, 54, 162, 486</math>.

Thus for <math>n=7</math> there are <math>2*3^5=\boxed{486}</math> permutations.

When you are faced with a brain-fazing equation and combinatorics is part of the problem, use recursion! This same idea appeared on another AIME with an 8-box problem.
