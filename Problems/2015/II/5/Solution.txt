==Solution 1==
Call the given grid "Grid A". Consider Grid B, where the vertices of Grid B fall in the centers of the squares of Grid A; thus, Grid B has dimensions <math>(n-1) \times (n-1)</math>. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the edges of Grid B and the number of adjacent pairs of unit squares in Grid A. The number of edges in Grid B is <math>2n(n-1)</math>, and the number of ways to pick two squares out of Grid A is <math>\dbinom{n^2}{2}</math>. So, the probability that the two chosen squares are adjacent is <math>\frac{2n(n-1)}{\binom{n^2}{2}} = \frac{2n(n-1)}{\frac{n^2(n^2-1)}{2}} = \frac{4}{n(n+1)}</math>. We wish to find the smallest positive integer <math>n</math> such that <math>\frac{4}{n(n+1)} < \frac{1}{2015}</math>, and by inspection the first such <math>n</math> is <math>\boxed{090}</math>.
