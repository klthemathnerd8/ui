Clearly the line and the coordinate axes form a right triangle. Since the x-intercept and y-intercept are 5 and 12 respectively, 5 and 12 are two sides of the triangle that are not the hypotenuse, and are thus two of the three heights. In order to find the third height, we can use different equations of the area of the triangle. Using the lengths we know, the area of the triangle is $\tfrac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 12= 30$. We can use the hypotenuse as another base to find the third height. Using the distance formula, the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{5^2+12^2}=13$. Then $\frac{1}{2} \times 13 \times h=30$, and so $h = \frac{60}{13}$. Therefore the sum of all the heights is $5+12+\frac{60}{13}=\boxed{\textbf{(E)}\; \frac{281}{13}}$.
