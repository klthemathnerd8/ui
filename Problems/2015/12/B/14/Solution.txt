The area of the circle is $\pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi$, and the area of the triangle is $\frac{4^2 \cdot\sqrt{3}}{4} = 4\sqrt{3}$. The difference between the area of the region that lies inside the circle but outside the triangle and the area of the region that lies inside the triangle but outside the circle is the same as the difference between the area of the circle and the area of the triangle (because from both pieces we are subtracting the area of the two shapes' intersection), so the answer is $4\pi-4\sqrt{3}  = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\;  4(\pi-\sqrt{3})}$.
