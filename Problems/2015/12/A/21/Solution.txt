==Solution 1==

We can graph the ellipse by seeing that the center is $(0, 0)$ and finding the ellipse's intercepts. The points where the ellipse intersects the coordinate axes are $(0, 1), (0, -1), (4, 0)$, and $(-4, 0)$. Recall that the two foci lie on the major axis of the ellipse and are a distance of $c$ away from the center of the ellipse, where $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, with $a$ being half the length of the major (longer) axis and $b$ being half the minor (shorter) axis of the ellipse. We have that $c^2 = 4^2 - 1^2 \implies$ $c^2 = 15 \implies c = \pm \sqrt{15}$. Hence, the coordinates of both of our foci are $(\sqrt{15}, 0)$ and $(-\sqrt{15}, 0)$. In order for a circle to pass through both of these foci, we must have that the center of this circle lies on the y-axis.

The minimum possible value of $r$ belongs to the circle whose diameter's endpoints are the foci of this ellipse, so $a = \sqrt{15}$. The value for $b$ is achieved when the circle passes through the foci and only three points on the ellipse, which is possible when the circle touches $(0, 1)$ or $(0, -1)$. Which point we use does not change what value of $b$ is attained, so we use $(0, -1)$. Here, we must find the point $(0, y)$ such that the distance from $(0, y)$ to both foci and $(0, -1)$ is the same. Now, we have the two following equations. $$(\sqrt{15})^2 + (y)^2 = b^2$$ $$y + 1 = b \implies y = b - 1$$ Substituting for $y$, we have that $$15 + (b - 1)^2 = b^2 \implies -2b + 16 = 0.$$

Solving the above simply yields that $b = 8$, so our answer is $a + b = \sqrt{15} + 8 \textbf{ (D)}$.
