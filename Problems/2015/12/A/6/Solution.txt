This problem can be converted to a system of equations. Let $p$ be Pete's current age and $c$ be Claire's current age. 

The first statement can be written as $p-2=3(c-2)$. The second statement can be written as $p-4=4(c-4)$

To solve the system of equations:


$p=3c-4$

$p=4c-12$

$3c-4=4c-12$

$c=8$

$p=20.$

Let $x$ be the number of years until Pete is twice as old as his cousin.

$20+x=2(8+x)$

$20+x=16+2x$

$x=4$

The answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }4}$.
