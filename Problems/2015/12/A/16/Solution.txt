==Solution 1==
Drop altitudes of triangle $ABC$ and triangle $ABD$ down from $C$ and $D$, respectively. Both will hit the same point; let this point be $T$. Because both triangle $ABC$ and triangle $ABD$ are 3-4-5 triangles, $CT = DT = \dfrac{3\cdot4}{5} = \dfrac{12}{5}$. Because $CT^{2} + DT^{2} = 2\left(\frac{12}{5}\right)^{2} = \left(\frac{12}{5}\sqrt{2}\right)^{2} = CD^{2}$, it follows that the $CTD$ is a right triangle, meaning that $\angle CTD = 90^\circ$, and it follows that planes $ABC$ and $ABD$ are perpendicular to each other. Now, we can treat $ABC$ as the base of the tetrahedron and $TD$ as the height. Thus, the desired volume is $$V = \dfrac{1}{3} bh = \dfrac{1}{3}\cdot[ABC]\cdot TD = \dfrac{1}{3} \cdot 6 \cdot \dfrac{12}{5} = \dfrac{24}{5}$$ which is answer $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \dfrac{24}{5}}$
