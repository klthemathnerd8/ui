==Solution 1==
Let us start with the two circles in $L_0$ and the circle in $L_1$. Let the larger circle in $L_0$ be named circle $X$ with radius $x$ and the smaller be named circle $Y$ with radius $y$. Also let the single circle in $L_1$ be named circle $Z$ with radius $z$. Draw radii $x$, $y$, and $z$ perpendicular to the x-axis. Drop altitudes $a$ and $b$ from the center of $Z$ to these radii $x$ and $y$, respectively, and drop altitude $c$ from the center of $Y$ to radius $x$ perpendicular to the x-axis. Connect the centers of circles $x$, $y$, and $z$ with their radii, and utilize the Pythagorean Theorem. We attain the following equations. $$(x - z)^2 + a^2 = (x + z)^2 \implies a^2 = 4xz$$ $$(y - z)^2 + b^2 = (y + z)^2 \implies b^2 = 4yz$$ $$(x - y)^2 + c^2 = (x + y)^2 \implies c^2 = 4xy$$

We see that $a = 2\sqrt{xz}$, $b = 2\sqrt{yz}$, and $c = 2\sqrt{xy}$. Since $a + b = c$, we have that $2\sqrt{xz} + 2\sqrt{yz} = 2\sqrt{xy}$. Divide this equation by $2\sqrt{xyz}$, and this equation becomes the well-known relation of Descartes's Circle Theorem $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{z}}.$ We can apply this relationship recursively with the circles in layers $L_2, L_3, \cdots, L_6$.

Here, let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of all circles in layer $n$. The notation in the problem asks us to find the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of the radii in each circle in this collection, which is $\textstyle\sum_{n=0}^{6}S(n)$.  We already have that $S(0) = S(1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{z}} = \frac{1}{73} +  \frac{1}{70}$. Then, $S(2) = 2S(1) + S(0) = 3S(0)$. Additionally, $S(3) = 2S(2) + 2S(1) + S(0) = 9S(0)$, and $S(4) = 2S(3) + 2S(2) + 2S(1) + S(0) = 27S(0)$. Now, we notice that $S(n + 1) = 3S(n)$ because $S(n + 1) = 2S(n) + 2S(n - 1) + \cdots + 2S(1) + S(0)$, which is a power of $3.$ Hence, our desired sum is $(1 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243)(S(0)) = 365\left(\frac{1}{73} +  \frac{1}{70}\right)$. This simplifies to $365\left(\frac{143}{73(70)}\right) = \frac{143}{14} \textbf{(D)}$.

Note that the circles in this question are known as Ford circles.
