Consider all 1000-element subsets of the set <math>\{1, 2, 3, ... , 2015\}</math>.  From each such subset choose the least element.  The arithmetic mean of all of these least elements is <math> \frac{p}{q} </math>, where <math>p</math> and <math>q</math> are relatively prime positive integers.  Find <math>p + q</math>.
