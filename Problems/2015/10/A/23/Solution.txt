==Solution 1==
By Vieta's Formula, $a$ is the sum of the integral zeros of the function, and so $a$ is integral.

Because the zeros are integral, the discriminant of the function, $a^2 - 8a$, is a perfect square, say $k^2$. Then adding 16 to both sides and completing the square yields
$$(a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16.$$
Therefore $(a-4)^2 - k^2 = 16$ and
$$((a-4) - k)((a-4) + k) = 16.$$
Let $(a-4) - k = u$ and $(a-4) + k = v$; then, $a-4 = \dfrac{u+v}{2}$ and so $a = \dfrac{u+v}{2} + 4$. Listing all possible $(u, v)$ pairs (not counting transpositions because this does not affect ($u + v$), $(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)$, yields $a = 9, 8, -1, 0$. These $a$ sum to $16$, so our answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}$.
