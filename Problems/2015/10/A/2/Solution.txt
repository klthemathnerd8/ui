==Solution==

Let $a$ be the amount of triangular tiles and $b$ be the amount of square tiles.

Triangles have $3$ edges and squares have $4$ edges, so we have a system of equations.

We have $a + b$ tiles total, so $a + b = 25$.

We have $3a + 4b$ edges total, so $3a + 4b = 84$.

Multiplying the first equation by $3$ on both sides gives $3a + 3b = 3(25) = 75$.

Second equation minus the first equation gives $b = 9$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }9}$.
