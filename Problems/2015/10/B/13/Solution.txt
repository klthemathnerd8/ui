==Solution 1==
We find the $x$-intercepts and the $y$-intercepts to find the intersections of the axes and the line. If $x=0$, then $y=12$. If $y$ is $0$, then $x=5$. Our three vertices are $(0,0)$, $(5,0)$, and $(0,12)$. Two of our altitudes are $5$ and $12$, and since it is a $5$-$12$-$13$ right triangle, the hypotenuse is $13$. Since the area of the triangle is $30$, so our final altitude is $\frac{30(2)}{13}=\frac{60}{13}$. The sum of our altitudes is $\frac{60+156+65}{13}=\boxed{\textbf{(E)} \dfrac{281}{13}}$. Note that there is no need to calculate the final answer after we know that the third altitude has length $\frac{60}{13}$ since $E$ is the only choice with a denominator of $13$ and $13$ is relatively prime to $5$ and $12$.
