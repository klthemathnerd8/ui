==Solution 1==

Expanding the equation and combining like terms results in $2x^2-(a+2b+c)x+(ab+bc)=0$. By Vieta's formula the sum of the roots is $\dfrac{-[-(a+2b+c)]}{2}=\dfrac{a+2b+c}{2}$. To maximize this expression we want $b$ to be the largest, and from there we can assign the next highest values to $a$ and $c$. So let $b=9$, $a=8$, and $c=7$. Then the answer is $\dfrac{8+18+7}{2}=\boxed{\textbf{(D)} 16.5}$.
