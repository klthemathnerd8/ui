===Solution 1===

When they score a $40$ on the next game, the range increases from $73-42=31$ to $73-40=33$.  This means the $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } \text{range}}$ increased.

Note: The range is defined to be the difference of the largest element and the smallest element of a set.

===Solution 2===

Because $40$ is less than the score of every game they've played so far, the measures of center will never rise. Only measures of spread, such as the $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}~\text{range}}$, may increase.
