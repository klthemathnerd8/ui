==Problem==

In the small country of Mathland, all automobile license plates have four symbols. The first must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, or U), the second and third must be two different letters among the 21 non-vowels, and the fourth must be a digit (0 through 9). If the symbols are chosen at random subject to these conditions, what is the probability that the plate will read "AMC8"?

$
\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{22,050} \qquad
\textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{21,000}\qquad
\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{10,500}\qquad
\textbf{(D) } \frac{1}{2,100} \qquad
\textbf{(E) } \frac{1}{1,050}
